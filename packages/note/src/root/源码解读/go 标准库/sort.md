# sort interface

定义了

```go
type Interface interface {
	// Len is the number of elements in the collection.
	Len() int

	// Less reports whether the element with index i
	// must sort before the element with index j.
	//
	// If both Less(i, j) and Less(j, i) are false,
	// then the elements at index i and j are considered equal.
	// Sort may place equal elements in any order in the final result,
	// while Stable preserves the original input order of equal elements.
	//
	// Less must describe a transitive ordering:
	//  - if both Less(i, j) and Less(j, k) are true, then Less(i, k) must be true as well.
	//  - if both Less(i, j) and Less(j, k) are false, then Less(i, k) must be false as well.
	//
	// Note that floating-point comparison (the < operator on float32 or float64 values)
	// is not a transitive ordering when not-a-number (NaN) values are involved.
	// See Float64Slice.Less for a correct implementation for floating-point values.
	Less(i, j int) bool

	// Swap swaps the elements with indexes i and j.
	Swap(i, j int)
}
