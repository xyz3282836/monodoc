The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers’ pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus. In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.

仍在持续的禽流感疫情使政府花费了大约 6.61 亿美元，在为限制病毒传播而宰杀了 5800 多万只禽类之后，消费者在超市付款时的痛苦也加剧了。 一位农业经济学家说，除了美国农业部统计的政府应对措施的成本以及鸡蛋、鸡肉和火鸡价格的上涨之外，饲养这些动物的农民很可能已经损失了 10 多亿美元，尽管还没有人计算出该行业在禽流感疫情中的损失总额。
