A rare blue supermoon appeared in the sky Wednesday night. A blue supermoon, or super blue moon, is the `confluence` of two events: A supermoon—when a full moon occurs within a day of the moon’s closest point of orbit to Earth—and a blue moon, when it’s the second full moon in a single month. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as many as two decades can `elapse` between blue supermoons, but about 10 years is the average. The next blue supermoons are expected in 2037, in January and again in March of that year, NASA said.
