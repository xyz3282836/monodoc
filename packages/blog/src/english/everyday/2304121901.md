Why do people `procrastinate`? A 2022 study in the journal Nature Communications suggests that a root of procrastination may lie in a `cognitive` `bias` — we believe that doing tasks will `somehow` be easier in the future. “You know it’s going to `stink` in the future just as much as it’s going to stink doing it now, but `internally` you just can’t help yourself,” said Samuel McClure, an associate professor of `psychology` and cognitive `neuroscientist` at Arizona State University. “It’s a `fascinating` phenomenon — that `myopia` you can’t escape — even though if you just stop and think about it, it’s `ludicrous`.”
