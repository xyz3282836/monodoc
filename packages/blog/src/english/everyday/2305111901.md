Vietnam has reported a record-high temperature of 44.1℃, as weather experts and authorities told the population to remain indoors during the hottest parts of the day. Scientists have said global warming is `aggravating` `adverse` weather. Neighbouring countries registered record temperatures during a heatwave in Asia in April. Vietnam’s record was measured indoors at Hoi Xuan station in northern Thanh Hoa province on Saturday, the National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting said, breaking the 2019 record of 43.4C.
