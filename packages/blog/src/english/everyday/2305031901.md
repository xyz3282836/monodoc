The worst habit for energy levels might surprise you. According to Dr. Mary Valvano, a physician from BetterNowMD, it’s eating your biggest meal at the end of the day. “The `adage` eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and supper like a `pauper` is actually based in biology,” she said. “Cells in our body `metabolize` food differently based on the time of day. Eating the same meal at 8 a.m. `versus` 6 p.m. can affect our body’s ability to use it for energy.” Eating a late meal, she explained ― especially very late at night ― can “`impair` our blood sugar levels and the ability to get optimal energy from the next day’s meals.”
