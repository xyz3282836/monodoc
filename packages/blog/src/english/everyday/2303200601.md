Wall Street’s `giants` moved to end the US’s `spiraling` banking crisis on Thursday by agreeing to `prop` up troubled First Republic, a mid-sized bank whose shares have been `pummeled` amid a wider banking `turmoil`. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others will deposit $30 billion in First Republic, which has seen customers `yank` their money following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and fears that First Republic could be next.
