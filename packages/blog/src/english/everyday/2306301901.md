Tech industry `hype` and `doomsday` `prophesies` around A.I.-enhanced chatbots like ChatGPT sent many schools `scrambling` this year to block or limit the use of the tools in classrooms. Newark Public Schools is taking a different approach. It is one of the first school systems in the United States to `pilot` test Khanmigo, an automated teaching `aid` developed by Khan Academy, an education nonprofit whose online lessons are used by hundreds of districts. Newark has essentially volunteered to be a `guinea` pig for public schools across the country that are trying to `distinguish` the practical use of new A.I.-assisted `tutoring` bots from their `marketing` promises.
