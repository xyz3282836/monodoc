Former President Donald Trump `surrendered` Thursday `on charges` that he illegally `schemed` to `overturn` the 2020 `election` in Georgia, a brisk 20-minute booking that `yielded` a historic first: a mug shot of a former American president. He was released on $200,000 bond and **headed back to** the airport for his return flight home to New Jersey. Trump’s surrender to law enforcement authorities has become by now a familiar election-season `routine` in a way that `belies` the `unprecedented` `spectacle` of a former president being booked, in four different cities, on `felony` criminal charges.
