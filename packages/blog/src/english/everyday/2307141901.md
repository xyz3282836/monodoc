As July 4 marks the birthday of giant panda He Hua, aka Hua Hua, her twin brother He Ye, and Meng Lan, Chinese netizens expressed their best wishes to the three top stars on social media platforms on Tuesday. In a video posted online, a group of fans of Hua Hua and He Ye sang the Happy Birthday song to the two birthday stars at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda `Breeding` in Sichuan Province and brought banners and posters to celebrate their birthday. To celebrate the three cute pandas' birthdays, keepers at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the Beijing Zoo, where Meng Lan lives, both prepared `elaborate` carrot-apple birthday cakes for them.
