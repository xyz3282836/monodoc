China’s young are getting married later than ever before. New government data shows that the average age for Chinese getting married in several provinces in 2022 was nearly 30, much higher than 2010 when the average age was 24. The trend only adds to growing concerns over the country’s population growth. Marriage registration data released by civil affairs departments from multiple provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, and Guangxi shows that the average age of residents getting married was between 27 and 30 in 2022, domestic media reported.

中国的年轻人比以前晚婚。新的政府数据显示，2022 年在几个省份结婚的中国人的平均年龄接近 30 岁，比 2010 年的平均婚龄 24 岁高得多。这一趋势只是增加了人们对中国人口增长的担忧。据国内媒体报道，江苏、浙江、河南和广西等多个省份的民政部门发布的婚姻登记数据显示，2022 年居民结婚的平均年龄在 27 至 30 岁之间。
