A man who opened an `emergency` exit on a flight in mid-air felt “`suffocated`” and wanted to get off quickly, South Korean police have said. The Asiana Airlines plane was carrying nearly 200 passengers as it `approached` the runway on Friday at Daegu international airport, about 150 miles south-east of Seoul, on a `domestic` flight. When the plane was about 200 metres (650 feet) above ground, the man who police said was in his 30s, without providing further details, opened the exit door. The passenger was taken in by Daegu police for questioning and told officers he had been “under stress after losing a job recently”.
