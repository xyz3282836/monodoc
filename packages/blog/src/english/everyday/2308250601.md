Rice prices `surged` to their highest in almost 12 years, after India’s rice export ban and `adverse` weather conditions `dented` production and supplies of Asia’s primary `staple` food, according to the UN’s food agency. Other than India, food inflation has been relatively `tame` in Asia so far this year. But a `confluence` of factors is `stoking` fears that shortage of rice supplies could mark a return to a broad increase in the prices of other food `commodities` in Asia.
