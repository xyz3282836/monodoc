This year's college entrance examination, also known as gaokao, kicks off on Wednesday across the nation. While parents of gaokao attenders prepare everything for their children, people from all walks of life are doing their own part to ensure that it runs smoothly for students. According to figures from the Ministry of Education, a record 12.91 million students across the country have applied for this year's gaokao, marking an increase of 980,000 from last year.
