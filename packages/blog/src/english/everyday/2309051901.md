The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace may draw tourists from far and wide, but on Sunday visitors to the `landmark` were treated to a different sort of `spectacle`: a `parade` of corgis dressed up in `crowns`, `tiaras` and royal outfits. Around 20 royal fans and their pet corgis gathered to walk their dogs outside the palace in central London to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death. Corgis were the late queen’s constant companions since she was a child, and Elizabeth owned around 30 throughout her life. Generations of the dogs `descended` from Susan, a corgi that was given to the queen on her 18th birthday.
