California’s `iconic` mountain forests are in serious trouble, according to a series of recent studies. The latest — an `aerial` survey of the state’s most forested regions — shows that a `combination` of drought and `insect` damage `wiped` out a startling 36 million trees between 2021 and 2022. “These last three years have been the hardest, driest three years on record in California,” said Jeffrey Moore, a forester with the U.S. Forest Service and the lead researcher on the survey, which was `conducted` from July to October.
