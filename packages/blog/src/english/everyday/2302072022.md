A nine-year-old boy from Pennsylvania who loves science and computer programming has become one of the youngest ever high school graduates, and he has already started accumulating some credits toward his college degree. David Balogun recently received a diploma from Reach Cyber Charter School – based in his state’s capital of Harrisburg – after taking classes remotely from his family home in the Philadelphia suburb of Bensalem, the local television station WGAL reported Saturday. The achievement makes David one of the youngest known children to ever graduate high school, according to a list compiled by the history and culture website oldest.org.

一个来自宾夕法尼亚州，热爱科学和编程的九岁男孩成为了史上最年轻的高中毕业生之一，而且他已经开始为本科学位积攒学分了。 最近 David Balogun 在位于费城郊区的 Bensalem 的家中远程上课后，收获了来自里奇线上公立学校（Reach Cyber Charter School）的学位证书——这所学校位于他所在州的首府哈里斯堡，而当地电视台 WGAL 于周六报道了这一事件。 根据历史与文化网站 oldest.org 的编写的排名清单，这一成就让 David 成为了史上最年轻的高中毕业生之一。
