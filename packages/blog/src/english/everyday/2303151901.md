Last year’s Oscars were the most `dramatic` in recent memory, and the `fallout` is still being felt. Only a week ago, Chris Rock’s live `comedy` special – the first time he spoke at length about the moment Will Smith `slapped` him onstage – broke records for Netflix. Oscars `host` Jimmy Kimmel mentioned the incident in his `trailer` for this year’s show, as well as `teeing` up the telecast earlier this week. So: will the 95th Academy Awards be as overshadowed by the slap as the 94th? “Give me a second, I’ll `adjust` my danger zone here,” was Jimmy Kimmel’s first line.
