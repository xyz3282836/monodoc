Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s `ambitious` `satire` in which Margot Robbie’s `titular` `blonde` escapes Barbieland to experience the real world, has drawn `ecstatic` reactions from audiences at an early screening. Variety’s social media editor Katcy Stephan called the movie “perfection” and added: “Greta Gerwig delivers a `nuanced` `commentary` on what it means to be a woman in a `whimsical`, wonderful and laugh-out-loud funny `romp`. The entire `cast` `shines`, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in roles they were clearly born to play.” Meanwhile ScreenRant writer Joseph Deckelmeier said the film was “funny, `bombastic` and very smart”. “Greta Gerwig aims for the `fences` and hits a home run,” he added, calling Robbie “great” and Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu – who play Kens – “pure entertainment”.
