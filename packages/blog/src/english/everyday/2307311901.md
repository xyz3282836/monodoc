Tens of thousands of people were `evacuated` from their homes in Beijing as the `remnants` of Typhoon Doksuri dumped record rainfall on the city, grounding flights and flooding hundreds of roads on Monday, state media reported. Besides Beijing, heavy rain continued to `soak` the neighbouring city of Tianjin as well as Hebei province in the `wake` of Doksuri, which was downgraded to a `tropical` depression on the weekend. Three of the five rivers that make up the Hai river `basin` rose to dangerous levels on Monday. Some houses were washed into the Yongding river, and nearly 55,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Baoding city, state media reported.
