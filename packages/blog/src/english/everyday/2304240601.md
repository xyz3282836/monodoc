SpaceX’s Starship rocket exploded on Thursday, minutes after lifting off from a launchpad in South Texas. The `spacecraft`, the most powerful ever to launch, failed to reach orbit, but it was not a total failure for the private `spaceflight` company. Before the launch, Elon Musk, the company’s founder, had `tamped` down `expectations`, saying it might take several tries before Starship succeeds at this test flight, which was to reach speeds fast enough to enter orbit before `splashing` down in the `Pacific Ocean` near Hawaii.
