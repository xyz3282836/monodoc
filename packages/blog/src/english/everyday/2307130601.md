Meta Platforms' Twitter `rival` Threads crossed 100 million sign-ups within five days of launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday, `dethroning` ChatGPT as the fastest-growing online platform to hit the milestone. Threads has been setting records for user growth since its launch on Wednesday, with celebrities, `politicians` and other newsmakers joining the platform that is seen by analysts as the first serious threat to the Elon Musk-owned microblogging app. "That's mostly `organic` demand, and we haven't even turned on many `promotions` yet," Zuckerberg said in a Threads post announcing the milestone.
