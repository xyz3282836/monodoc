An 11-minute `brisk` walk every day could prevent one in ten early deaths, according to a new study from Cambridge University. UK guidelines tell people to aim for at least 150 minutes of `moderate` `intensity` physical activity each week — a category that includes a `brisk` walk, riding a bike, dancing, mowing the lawn and in-line skating. However, the researchers found that just 75 minutes a week appeared to `substantially` reduce the risks of early death, `cardiovascular` disease and certain cancers, including those of the head and neck and `myeloid` `leukaemia`.
