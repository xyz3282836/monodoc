Prince William was paid a “very large sum” by Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper group to settle phone-hacking claims, according to court documents submitted Tuesday by the legal team of his younger brother, Prince Harry. Harry is suing Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) at the High Court in London for unlawful acts — including hacking his voice mails — that he `alleges` were committed on behalf of the Sun and the now-defunct News of the World `tabloids` from 1994 until 2016.
