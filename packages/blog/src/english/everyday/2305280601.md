A man who was `paralysed` in a cycling accident in 2011 has been able to stand and walk with an aid after doctors `implanted` a device that reads his brain waves and sends instructions to his `spine` to move the right muscles. Gert-Jan Oskam, 40, was told he would never walk again after breaking his neck in a traffic accident, but has climbed `stairs` and walked for more than 100 metres at a time since having the operation. “A few months ago, I was able, for the first time after 10 years, to stand up and have a `beer` with my friends,” said Oskam. “That was pretty cool. I want to use it in my daily life.”
