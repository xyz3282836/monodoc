It is a habit that has become `ingrained` in so many consumers that you could be forgiven for thinking there was no other way: dumping your old and tired tech for a `shinier` model every year or two, `shelling` out hundreds of pounds in the process. But a new generation of technology is `creeping` into the mainstream that is designed to upend this consumerist `churn` – devices that can be taken apart, repaired and upgraded by the user, and not via an over-priced service. Once `niche`, these phones, headphones and laptops are `vying` for the same customers that buy iPhones and Samsung devices.
