The `union` representing Hollywood actors `formally` announced a strike on Thursday, `expanding` the `standoff` between Hollywood workers and studio executives over wages, AI technology and how to divide the profits of the new digital streaming `era`. The strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American `Federation` of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra), which will begin on Friday, will mark the first time in 63 years that Hollywood writers and actors are striking `simultaneously`. Hollywood writers went on strike in early May. Now the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) will be joined by some of Sag-Aftra’s 160,000 members.
