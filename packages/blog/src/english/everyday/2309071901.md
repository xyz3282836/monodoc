Venice will `trial` a ticketing system from spring next year, with day visitors charged €5 to enter the Italian city’s historic centre in an attempt to reduce tourist numbers. The city’s `council` executive backed the move on Tuesday, just weeks after UNESCO recommended Venice be added to its list of world `heritage` sites in danger, in part due to the impact of mass tourism. Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, said: “`Regulating` tourist flows in certain periods is necessary, but that does not mean closing the city. Venice will always be open to everyone.”
