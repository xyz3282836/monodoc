Twitter changed its iconic blue bird logo on Monday to `mimic` the logo of a popular `cryptocurrency` – an image of a dog that featured in viral `memes` – in what appears to be a late April fool’s day `gag` from the company’s billionaire owner, Elon Musk. On Monday, US time, users noted that the blue bird logo on Twitter’s homepage and loading screen had been replaced with the shiba inu image associated with the Dogecoin memecoin cryptocurrency. In typical Musk fashion, he `tweeted` a meme noting the change.
