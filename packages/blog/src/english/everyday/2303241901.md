Rupert Murdoch. Professionally, the parent of Earth’s media. Personally, the creator of new news himself. Celebrating March, his Nativity month, a new `scoop` is Mr. Murdoch’s getting married — again. But first, before anything, we discuss the important `stuff`. Like his bride-to-be’s Asscher-cut diamond `solitaire` which the almost `groom` personally selected. He says: “I’m one-fourth Irish.” He presented the ring to her on St. Pat’s Day in our very own NYC. He says: “I was very nervous. I dreaded falling in love — but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy.”
