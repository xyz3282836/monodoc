Shipment of contaminated waste from the site of a fiery train derailment earlier this month in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line will resume Monday to two approved sites in Ohio, according to federal environmental authorities. The announcement came a day after the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern to “pause” shipments from the site of the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine to allow additional oversight measures about where waste was shipped. Some liquid and solid waste had already been taken to sites in Michigan and Texas.

据美国联邦环保部门称，本月早些时候在俄亥俄州东部靠近宾夕法尼亚州边界的火车脱轨事故现场留下的污染废物，将于周一重新开始转运到俄亥俄州的两个获批地点。 这一消息是在环境保护局命令诺福克南方公司“叫停”从 2 月 3 日东巴勒斯坦脱轨事故现场转运的一天后宣布的，是为了对废物的运输地点采取更多监督措施。而一些液体和固体废物已经被运往密歇根州和德克萨斯州。
