Elon Musk may want to send “tweet” back to the birds, but the `ubiquitous` term for posting on the site he now calls X is here to stay — at least for now. For one, the word is still `plastered` all over the site formerly known as Twitter. Write a post, you still need to press a blue button that says “tweet” to publish it. To repost it, you still tap “retweet.” But it’s more than that. With “tweets,” Twitter accomplished in just a few years something few companies have done in a lifetime: It became a verb and `implanted` itself into the `lexicon` of America and the world. `Upending` that takes more than a top-down declaration.
