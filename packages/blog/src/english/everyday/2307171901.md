An `aggressive` sea otter in California is `hassling` locals by riding boards she stole from surfers in the `lineup`. Steamer Lane is a legendary point break `nestled` along the rocky `shores` of Santa Cruz, home to `swaths` of experienced surfers, as well as a 5-year-old female sea otter with a growing `reputation` for repeatedly `confronting` surfers and `kayakers`. Videos across social media show the otter `hoisting` itself out of the ocean and onto boards while surfers sit back in `awe`. At times she's `chewed` on the boards or forced surfers to `surrender` their boards altogether. Onlookers in the videos can be heard laughing in `jest` at surfers' `misfortune`, but officials with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say the otter poses a public safety risk.
