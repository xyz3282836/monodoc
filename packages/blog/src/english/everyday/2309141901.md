They charted the stars for `pitiful` `wages`, knowing their observations about the universe would be attributed to male `colleagues`, and died in relative `obscurity`, their scientific achievements unrecognised and overlooked. Now, in a `tribute` to `trailblazing` British female astronomers, two asteroids have been named for Annie Maunder and Alice Everett, among the first women in the world to earn a living in astronomy. Maunder and Everett, who became friends while studying mathematics at Girton College in Cambridge in the 1880s, were early members of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), which put their names forward to the Catalina Sky Survey for the honour.
