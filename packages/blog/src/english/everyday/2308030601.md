A zoo in eastern China has denied suggestions that some of its bears could be humans dressed in costumes, after video of one standing on its hind legs `circulated` online. In a statement published on Sunday from the `perspective` of Angela, a Malaysian sun bear, zookeepers at Hangzhou zoo said: “When it comes to bears, the first thing that comes to mind is a huge figure and amazing power … But not all bears are `behemoths` and danger personified. We Malayan bears are `petite`, the smallest bear in the world.”
