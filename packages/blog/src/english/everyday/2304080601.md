NASA has selected the astronauts for its Artemis II mission, which is planned for late 2024. This mission will take the four `crew` members in a figure of eight around the moon, the first time humans have visited the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The mission’s commander will be Reid Wiseman, who was NASA’s chief astronaut until November 2022 – meaning it is likely he was in charge of selecting the crew for Artemis II. He has been to space once before, travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014.
