Vietnam's iconic "kissing rocks" in the heart of Ha Long Bay are at risk of collapse, a report has warned. Ha Long Bay in Quang Ninh province is dotted with hundreds of tiny `islets`, attracting 4 million tourists in 2019. The twin rocks, which rise out of the `bay` and appear to touch - or "kiss" - are highly popular with visitors. But experts warned in a July report that rising sea levels and fishing boats travelling too close are causing the rocks to `erode`.
