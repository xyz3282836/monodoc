A 14-year-old boy from Massachusetts died unexpectedly a short time after he ate a particularly `spicy` `tortilla` chip, leaving his family `grieving` and searching for answers. Harris Wolobah died on Friday, said a statement from officials at the Worcester public school `district` where the boy studied. Harris’s cause of death had not been determined on Tuesday as results of his `autopsy` remained pending, but his relatives fear that `complications` from eating an extremely spicy tortilla chip from the manufacturer Paqui were a factor, according to an online GoFundMe **campaign meant to benefit his family**.
