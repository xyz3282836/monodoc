China’s current flu infection still remains at the level of a seasonal flu like in previous years before the COVID-19 `epidemic`, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of `the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention`, said on Tuesday in response to the public’s concerns over the current `influenza` spreading that shows an upward trend. The annual influenza `outbreak` has entered its high level lately with the influenza A (H1N1) virus `sweeping` across the country in `a matter of weeks`, bringing up the `proportion` of influenza-like illnesses in both southern and northern areas. A total of 390 influenza-like illness outbreaks were reported nationwide during the eighth week of 2023 between February 20 and 26.
