Apple is getting a lot of `flak` for setting up iPhones to charge when the sun shines or the wind blows. The feature, called “Clean Energy Charging,” `incited` a tiny but `vehement` Twitter `rebellion` as `critics`, many slammed it as yet another “woke” front in the culture war. Others worried they would wake up to a `depleted` battery if their iPhones charged mostly when the `grid` is cleanest. All of this misses the quiet revolution this feature represents for you and the electricity grid. When it rolled out its new operating system in October, Apple proved overnight that millions of `ordinary` people will use their devices to help manage the electricity grid.
