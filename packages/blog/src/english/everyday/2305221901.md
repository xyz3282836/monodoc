A tomb belonging to a Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) official was recently discovered in North China's Shanxi Province. The tomb was `unearthed` from the province's Yuncheng city after local `villagers` `spotted` an area of `soil` `collapse` in a farm. According to an `epitaph` in the tomb, the owner was Xue Huaiji, a cishi, or regional `inspector`. Over 300 relics, mainly pottery `artifacts` like `figurines` and animal-shaped `wares` and `bronze` wares, have been discovered in the tomb.
