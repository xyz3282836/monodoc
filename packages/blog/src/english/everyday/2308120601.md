Media outlets in South Korea have labelled its hosting of the World `Scout` `Jamboree` a “national disgrace”, a “survival game”, and a “worst nightmare”. Public `outcry` has `intensified` online and strangers are approaching scouts on the streets, apologising on behalf of their country and handing out gifts. South Korea has successfully hosted large events such as the Fifa World Cup and Winter Olympics, but the mismanagement of the global scouting event, which struggled with heat and `hygiene` and eventually had to be `evacuated` as a typhoon approached, has left many wondering: where did it all go wrong?
