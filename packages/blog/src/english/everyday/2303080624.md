The number of women seeking loans to build their own businesses tripled over the past five years, `credit research firm` TransUnion Cibil said in a report on Monday. The study added that the number of women `borrowers` grew at a `compounded` annual growth rate (`CAGR`) of 15 per cent during this period. That of male borrowers was up 11 per cent. “Our most recent analysis shows rapid growth in `credit` `uptake` by women across India’s `rural` and `semi-urban` geography. The share of women borrowers has increased from 25 per cent in 2017 to 28 per cent in 2022,” TransUnion Cibil said in the report.
