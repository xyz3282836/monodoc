A 13-year-old boy has survived after `slipping` and falling nearly 100ft (30m) at the `Grand` `Canyon` in the US state of Arizona. It took rescue crews two hours to pull Wyatt Kauffman to safety on Tuesday after falling off a `ledge` at the popular tourist site's North Rim. He was flown to hospital with serious injuries but has since been `discharged`. Wyatt told a local television station he had fallen while moving out of the way so people could take pictures. He said he had been `squatting` down and holding onto a rock with one hand when he lost his grip and started to fall back.
