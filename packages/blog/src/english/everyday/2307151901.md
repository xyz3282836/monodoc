An Edinburgh woman who was ordered to repaint her pink door is facing a new `council` investigation over its latest colour. Miranda Dickson, 48, recently painted her door in the New Town "an off-white" after a previous green `makeover` was rejected by planners. But Edinburgh Council has now received a fresh complaint that the door is back to pink. Last year Ms Dickson faced a £20,000 fine if she did not change the colour. Ms Dickson said she was `stunned` by the latest development. She said: "I am speechless that someone has complained about this colour as far as I was concerned this chapter in my life was closed. I feel `bullied` and that it has now become personal."
