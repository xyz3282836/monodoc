Ant-Man often bests his enemies by shrinking to the size of an insect or growing as tall as a skyscraper, as the situation demands. The character’s ticket sales seem to be supersizing with each new movie that comes out. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” from Walt Disney Marvel Studios, overcame middling reviews from critics to earn $104 million in domestic ticket sales in its debut, making it the third-highest grossing February release ever, after the 2016 superhero comedy “Deadpool” and Marvel’s 2018 blockbuster “Black Panther,” according to box-office tracker Comscore.

蚁人经常根据情况需要，通过缩小到虫子大小或长到摩天大楼那么高，来打败他的敌人。这个角色的票房似乎也随着每部新电影的上映而不断增高。 根据票房跟踪网站 Comscore 的数据，华特·迪士尼旗下漫威工作室的《蚁人与黄蜂女：量子狂潮》面对影评人的中等评价，在首映周末斩获 1.04 亿美元的（美国）国内票房收入，是有史以来 2 月上映电影的第三高票房，仅次于 2016 年的超级英雄喜剧《死侍》和 2018 年的漫威大片《黑豹》。
