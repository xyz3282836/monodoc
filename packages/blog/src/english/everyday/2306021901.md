Canada has `unveiled` plans for a big increase in the number of immigrants entering the country, with a goal of seeing 500,000 people arrive each year by 2025 as it seeks to address a `critical` labor `shortage`.Immigration Minister Sean Fraser revealed the new plan on Tuesday. It puts a heavy emphasis on `admitting` more `permanent` residents with needed work skills and experience, alongside more-modest targets for family members and `refugees`. The `opposition` `Conservative` party welcomed the plan.
