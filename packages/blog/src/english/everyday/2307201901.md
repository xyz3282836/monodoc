A 2007 Apple iPhone has been sold at `auction` for \$190,372.80 (£145,416) – 300 times its original sale price. The 4GB model , originally bought for \$599, was still in its factory wrapping and was in `exceptional` condition, the auction listing said. The auctioneer LCG Auctions described the device as a “popular high-end `collectible`” and “exceedingly rare”. The auction attracted 28 `bids` in total after an initial bid of \$10,000. LCG Auctions sold another first-generation iPhone for \$63,356 in February. Another `firm`, Wright Auctions, sold a first-generation iPhone for \$40,320 in March. LCG described the phone as a “`holy` `grail`” among iPhone collectors due to its extreme `scarcity`. It is uncommon to find a first-generation iPhone with no damage to its display or broken buttons.
