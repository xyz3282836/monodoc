The People's Liberation Army `Air Force` now has its first female pilots who can operate heavy-duty fighter jets. The Air Force said the five female flight students, who are currently in the middle of training for heavy-duty `combat` `aircraft`, recently `carried out` their first solo flights in the J-11 fighter jet. During the flights, the female `aviators` `conducted` some difficult `maneuvers` and received high scores from their instructors. The students, with an average age of 23, will next start training in `aerial`-battle maneuvers and `tactics`, as well as land-attack skills, according to `academy` commanders.
