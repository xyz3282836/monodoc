A leading Chinese university is introducing shared rooms for married students, the latest university to roll out `pro-marriage` policies for its students. According to Wuhan University’s announcement on Thursday, married students can apply to live in the same dorm room as long as both are full-time students with a marriage license. A staff member of the university’s `logistics` department told state media that the dorms are aimed at married Ph.D. students. The staff said they first received requests from Ph.D. students a few years ago and have now prepared around eight couple rooms.
