High-tech `athletic` clothes made with `anti-odor` `fabrics` are popular. But they also come with a little-known health `hazard`: The `apparel` may be `infused` with metal `fibers` that can cause burns in an MRI. “It’s like putting your skin up against a hot `plate`,” said Dr. Hollis Potter, chairman of the radiology and imaging department at the Hospital for Special `Surgery` in New York City. Lululemon, one of the largest athletic apparel brands, `boasts` on its website that its “Silverescent” technology infuses silver fibers into fabric to make it “`stink`-stopping.” But the company declined to discuss which of its clothes may contain metal fiber.
