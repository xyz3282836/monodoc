Authorities in Delhi are taking steps to `scare` away monkeys from `venues` linked to the G20 summit. Life-size cut-outs of grey `langur` monkeys - which scare smaller monkeys - have been put up at various places and there are plans to deploy people trained to `mimic` the animal's sounds. Delhi has a huge monkey population and authorities hope these steps will keep the animals from disrupting the summit. India will host the meeting of G20 leaders on 9 and 10 September.
