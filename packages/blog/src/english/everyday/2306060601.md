As of 8 am on Sunday, Central China's Henan Province had harvested 47.58 million mu (3.17 million `hectares`) of winter wheat, accounting for 55.8 percent of its total, China Media Group reported. As a major wheat producer in China, Henan had persistent rain recently during the critical harvest period, which has been called the worst `scenario` in a decade. In order to minimize the impact, farmers have been working in the fields day and night with harvesters in operation 24 hours a day.
