The eastern Chinese city of Zibo, mostly known for its `manufacturing` industries, has `emerged` as one of the country’s most popular tourist spots — thanks to its barbecue. `Favored` by `swarms` of so-called internet influencers, the city in Shandong province has gone viral on Chinese social media platforms. Videos on sites such as Xiaohongshu show thousands of people traveling to the city to savor local barbecue, which they say is wrapped in a `pancake`, has a “distinct taste,” and offers an `immersive` dining experience.
