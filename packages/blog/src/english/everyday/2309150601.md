Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope may have discovered `tentative` evidence of a sign of life on a faraway planet. It may have detected a `molecule` called dimethyl sulphide (DMS). On Earth, at least, this is only produced by life. The researchers stress that the detection on the planet 120 light years away is "not `robust`" and more data is needed to confirm its presence. Researchers have also detected `methane` and CO2 in the planet's atmosphere. Detection of these gases could mean the planet, named K2-18b, has a water ocean.
