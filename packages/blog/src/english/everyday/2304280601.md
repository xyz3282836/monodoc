Google’s advertising `malaise` persisted during the first quarter while the internet company also grapples with advancements in artificial intelligence technology that threaten to `undercut` its dominant search engine. An `unprecedented` `downturn` in Google’s digital ad revenue – the company’s main moneymaker for more than 20 years – came into sharper focus Tuesday with the release of the January-March results for owner Alphabet Inc. Although Alphabet’s total revenue for the period rose from a year earlier, Google’s first-quarter ad sales of $54.5 billion marked a `slight` decrease from a year ago.
