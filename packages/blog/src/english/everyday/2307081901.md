`Saturn` has a fresh new look thanks to NASA’s Webb Space Telescope. The gas giant is dark in the latest photo by Webb, released Friday, but its `icy` rings are glowing. Webb snapped the picture in the `infrared` last weekend. At this `wavelength`, the planet appears dark because sunlight is `absorbed` by `methane` in the atmosphere. But the icy rings remain bright. Three of Saturn’s many moons also got caught on camera.
