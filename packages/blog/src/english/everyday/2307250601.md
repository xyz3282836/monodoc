Q: How does the world's biggest pizza brand respond to high inflation in the world's most populous nation? A: With the world's cheapest Domino's pizza. The 49-rupee ($0.60) pizza in India, Domino's No.1 market outside America, is the tip of the `spear` in its fight against `rampant` inflation that's `squeezing` profits and pricing out many customers, according to the CEO of its `franchisee` there. The company wants to "own that price point", said Sameer Khetarpal, confirming the `stripped-down`, seven-inch cheese pizza with a `sprinkle` of `basil` and `parsley` is Domino's cheapest anywhere. "You are coming to the store or open the app, because there is a 49-rupee `callout`," he said, adding that Domino's global team supported the plans. "Customers are going to eat out less because prices are higher everywhere—our existing consumers should not go out to some competition."
