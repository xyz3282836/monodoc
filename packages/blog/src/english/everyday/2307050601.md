TikTok and Instagram users can scroll with `abandon`. But Twitter owner Elon Musk has put new `curfews` on his digital town `square`, the latest `drastic` change to the social media platform that could further drive away advertisers and `undermine` its cultural influence as a trendsetter. Keeping up with a sports game, `extreme` weather conditions or a major news event is getting harder under Musk’s new rules, which `cap` the number of tweets you can view as part of an `apparent` attempt to relieve the company’s overloaded web infrastructure.
