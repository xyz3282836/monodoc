An `alpine` guide has discovered on Austria’s fastest `melting` `glacier` what are believed to be the remains of an Austrian who died more than 20 years ago, according to a statement from local police. The discovery follows the finding of other human remains on the same glacier less than two months ago. Climate change has accelerated the melting of glaciers, with the `retreating` ice releasing bodies of `alpinists` it has held for years, sometimes even decades.
