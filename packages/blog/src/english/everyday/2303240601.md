Google’s Bard chatbot is launching on Tuesday in the UK and US, as the company completes its `dash` to release a competitor to Bing Chat and ChatGPT. It is seen as a `do-or-die` moment for the company, whose profitable web search service risks being `outcompeted` by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots – even if those chatbots currently have problems in consistently returning accurate and useful results. Describing the service as an “experiment”, Google’s Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Bard, said the company was “extremely excited … watching how people are using this product in a way that’s boosting their creativity.”
