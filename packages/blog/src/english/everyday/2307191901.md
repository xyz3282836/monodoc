A suggestion put forward by a netizen on the official website of China’s Ministry of `Civil` Affairs advocating for simplified marriage registration documents has `ignited` widespread `debate` online on the need for `mandatory` parental permission before marriage. Since 2003, regulations in China `dictate` that citizens must provide both a government-issued photo ID and a household register, also known as the hukou, when registering a marriage. However, in the comment on the website on June 27, the netizen argued that this requirement is unreasonable, `asserting` that the photo ID carries the same legal weight as the household register. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has acknowledged the suggestion and expressed their intention to examine it further.
