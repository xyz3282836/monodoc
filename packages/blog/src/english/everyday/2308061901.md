While Barbie continues to achieve box office success around the world, the film’s performance in South Korea has been `lacklustre`, with critics `citing` a `reluctance` to `embrace` a `feminist`-themed foreign movie. Barbie sold just over 460,000 tickets between 19 July, when it hit screens locally, according to the Korean Film Council. The film’s opening weekend received only an 8% share of total box office revenue and just 3.9% for the second weekend. In comparison, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has sold over 3.6m tickets since its release on 12 July.
