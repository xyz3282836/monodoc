The Chinese `duo` Zou Jiaqi and Qiu Xiuping `bagged` the first gold medal of the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou in the women's `lightweight` double `sculls`. The pair shared their proud feelings of winning in the hometown and their top goals for the Paris Olympics 2024. During an interview on Sunday afternoon, the duo shared with the Global Times their `shiny` gold medals, as well as their `calloused` and `scarred` hands. They said they didn't feel exhausted or `laborious` because of it. "People in all walks of life have hard times. Since we chose this path, we must `strive` to be the best we can be," said Qiu.
