A `curious` toddler on Tuesday earned the title of the `tiniest` White House `intruders` after he `squeezed` through the metal fencing on the north side of the executive `mansion`. U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division officers, who are responsible for security at the White House, walked across the North Lawn to `retrieve` the `tot` and `reunite` him with his parents on Pennsylvania Avenue. Access to the complex was briefly restricted while officers `conducted` the `reunification`. Officers briefly questioned the parents before allowing them to continue on their way.
