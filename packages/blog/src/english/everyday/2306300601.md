The `flatbread` `depicted` in the 2,000-year-old `fresco` "may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish", Italy's culture `ministry` said. But it lacks the classic `ingredients` to technically be considered a pizza. The fresco was found in the hall of a house next to a `bakery` during recent `digs` at the site in southern Italy. The discovery was made this year during new `excavations` of Regio IX in the centre of Pompeii, one of the nine districts that the ancient site is divided into.
