A man died Wednesday after he was dragged by a Metro train when a dog’s leash that was attached to him became caught in the doors, transit officials said. Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said the incident occurred shortly before 1:30 p.m., when Metro’s Rail Operations Control Center and transit police received a report of a person being dragged by a train at the Dunn Loring station in Fairfax County. Jannetta said the man was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.
