In an effort to enhance the experience for international travelers, WeChat Pay and Alipay — China’s leading mobile payment apps — have begun introducing new features that allow users to link the platforms with their international credit cards. With international inbound travel `gradually` `resuming`, this move will `eliminate` the need for foreign users to navigate through the previously `cumbersome` registration process, which involved setting up a Chinese bank account or registering a local phone number.
