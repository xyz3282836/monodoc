As a direct consequence from the problem of `obesity` the fitness `commitment` `counselor` position will emerge. Although we have a lot of technology to track and help with daily movement, such as fitbits, it still can’t go the full length as it can’t hold the wearer `accountable` for their health. In the future clients will not only wear an activity tracker, but also have a fitness commitment counselor to keep them motivated and on track to better health.
