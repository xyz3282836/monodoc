Marketa Vondrousova came to the All England Club a year ago unable to play tennis at all. She had a `cast` on her `surgically` repaired left `wrist`, so her visit was limited to sightseeing around London with her sister and cheering for a friend who was competing at Wimbledon. This trip was a lot more memorable: She is leaving as a `Grand` `Slam` champion. Vondrousova became the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon on Saturday, coming back in each set for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over 2022 `runner-up` Ons Jabeur in the final.
