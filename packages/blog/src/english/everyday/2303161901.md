A song by a group of men who were `incarcerated` as a result of their involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack has risen to number 1 on the iTunes singles chart, besting the likes of Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Rihanna for the top spot. "`Justice` for All" by the J6 Prison Choir, featuring the voice of Donald Trump, is aimed at "supporting certain prisoners denied their `constitutional` rights," and consists of a `rendition` of "The Star-Spangled Banner" `interspersed` with the former president's `pledge` of `allegiance`. Trump has previously called for the January 6 `rioters` to be released, saying they had been treated unfairly and that e would consider pardoning their sentences should his 2024 presidential bid be successful.

一群因参与 1 月 6 日国会大厦袭击事件而入狱的人演唱的歌曲在 iTunes 单曲榜上升至第一，超过了麦莉·赛勒斯、Lady Gaga 和蕾哈娜等人的作品登顶榜首。“J6 监狱合唱团”的《所有人享有正义》，以唐纳德·特朗普的声音为特色，旨在“支持某些被剥夺宪法权利的囚犯”，由合唱团演唱的《星条旗永不落》和前总统特朗普朗诵的效忠宣誓穿插而成。 特朗普此前曾呼吁释放参加 1 月 6 日暴乱的暴徒，称他们受到了不公平的对待，如果他在 2024 年的总统竞选中获胜，他将考虑赦免他们的刑期。
