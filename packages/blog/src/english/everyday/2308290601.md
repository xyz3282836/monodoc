Shein and Forever 21 may soon be fast-fashion friends. The two `rivals` have entered into a partnership that `paves` the way for the Asian e-`commerce` powerhouse to sell Forever 21 dresses, jeans and `accessories` on its site. `Down the line`, Shein shops could operate inside Forever 21 stores, the companies said. The `arrangement` marks the next step in Shein’s evolution beyond selling `apparel` at `rock-bottom` prices produced in small batches. Shein has become one of the largest U.S. fast-fashion retailers by market share, but to grow further it wants to offer its customers goods beyond what it makes itself.
