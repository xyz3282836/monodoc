An Ontario woman and her family are suing Canada’s best-known coffee chain for C$500,000 ($366,000), alleging Tim Hortons served her “superheated” tea in a defective cup that left her with “horrific” burns on her body. Jackie Lansing, 73, ordered a black tea while at a drive-through in southern Ontario last year. Lansing, who was in the passenger seat of a vehicle, picked up the cup, which “immediately collapsed in on itself”, according to her statement of claim. “As a result, approximately 14 ounces of scalding hot liquid spilled on Ms Lansing’s stomach and legs,” her claim reads. “The tea provided was a hazard rather than a beverage.”
