An Ontario woman and her family are `suing` Canada’s best-known coffee chain for C$500,000 ($366,000), `alleging` Tim Hortons served her “superheated” tea in a `defective` cup that left her with “horrific” burns on her body. Jackie Lansing, 73, ordered a black tea while at a drive-through in southern Ontario last year. Lansing, who was in the `passenger` seat of a `vehicle`, picked up the cup, which “immediately collapsed in on itself”, according to her statement of claim. “As a result, approximately 14 `ounces` of `scalding` hot liquid `spilled` on Ms Lansing’s `stomach` and legs,” her claim reads. “The tea provided was a `hazard` rather than a `beverage`.”
