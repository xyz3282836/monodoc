A track for live horse racing in `suburban` Seattle turned prehistoric over the weekend as more than 200 people ran down the track `cloaked` in inflatable Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur costumes. The 2023 T-Rex World Championships at Emerald Downs — an event that started in 2017 as a `pest` control company’s team-building activity — ended in a photo finish on Sunday, with three competitors hitting the finish line together. Ocean Kim took top honors in the 100-yard (91.2-meter) `dash` after officials agreed Kim, of Kailua, Hawaii, hit the finish wire just ahead of the pack.
