The Netherlands is set to hand back hundreds of precious artefacts taken from Indonesia and Sri Lanka during its `colonial` period. Objects to be returned include a `gem`-`encrusted` `bronze` `cannon` and a `looted` cache of `jewels` from the "Lombok treasure". A report had urged the government to return items if countries request them. The agreed `restitution` comes as the Netherlands increasingly `confronts` its colonial past. Other countries have also began returning `precious` looted artefacts in recent years . Notable examples include British and German museums signing over some of the so-called Benin Bronzes stolen from Nigeria during a large-scale 1897 British `military` `expedition`.
