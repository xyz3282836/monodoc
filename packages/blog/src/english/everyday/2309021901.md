What do you see when you look at this photo? The image appears to show an `enormous`, scary face suddenly emerging from the ocean. But what you're actually looking at is a `stargazer` fish which has `buried` itself in the sandy floor of the Mediterranean. The photo was taken by Pietro Formis from Italy and is among several to be highly commended in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year. Mr Formis explained that he doesn't normally take photos for competitions. He submitted this image because he "liked it a lot" but didn't expect to win any commendation.
