Haruki Murakami wrote a story of a walled city when he was `fresh off` his `debut`. More than four decades later, as a `seasoned` and `acclaimed` novelist, he gave it a new life as “The City and Its Uncertain Walls.” It was three years ago when he felt the time had come to revisit the story that he thought was `imperfect` but had important elements, such as the wall and the shadow, and `tackle` them again based on what he was feeling on his skin. “Because of the `coronavirus` … I hardly went out and stayed home most of the time, and I tended to look at my inner self. Then I thought, perhaps it’s time to write that story,” Murakami said. And he did, “as if recovering it from the back of a `drawer`.”
