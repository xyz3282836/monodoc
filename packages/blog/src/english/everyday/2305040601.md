China celebrates Youth Day every May 4. It was established to honor the `patriotic` and `anti-imperialist` May Fourth Movement on May 4, 1919, when a group of Chinese students `protested` the weak `diplomatic` response of the then Chinese government to the Treaty of Versailles, marking the beginning of China's new `democratic` revolution. People expressed their anger through `demonstrations` and strikes. The greater movements finally pressed the government to refuse to sign the Treaty.
