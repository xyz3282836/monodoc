`Rescuers` raced Saturday to search for survivors and help hundreds of people left homeless after a powerful `tornado` cut a `devastating` path through Mississippi, killing at least 25 people, `injuring` dozens, and `flattening` entire blocks for more than an hour. One person was killed in Alabama. The tornado devastated a `swath` of the Mississippi Delta town of Rolling Fork, reducing homes to `piles` of `rubble`, `flipping` cars on their sides and `toppling` the town’s water tower.
