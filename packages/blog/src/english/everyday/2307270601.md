Typhoon Doksuri, a tropical cyclone moving through the Pacific Ocean with wind speeds equivalent to those of a Category 3 hurricane, grazed the northern Philippines on Wednesday morning and was expected to make landfall in China later this week. The storm was hovering on Wednesday near a group of small islands north of Luzon, the largest and most populous island in the Philippines, the national meteorological service said in a bulletin. The storm had killed at least one person, left at least two others injured and displaced more than 11,000 residents by Wednesday morning, the country’s disaster agency said in a separate update. About 180,000 people had been affected across the country, it said.
