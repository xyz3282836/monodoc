When Tesla's founder Elon Musk landed at a Beijing airport on Tuesday, his first visit to China in three years, he may have expected a hearty welcome from Chinese officials and employees at Tesla's `plant` in Shanghai, but he may not have expected that his visit would have `attracted` such `enormous` attention among Chinese `netizens` that the details of his dinner menu were spreading fast on China's social media platforms. The 52-year-old South African-born US billionaire is among a string of global multinational executives to have visited China this year shortly after the country optimized its COVID-19 response and opened its arms to global travelers.
