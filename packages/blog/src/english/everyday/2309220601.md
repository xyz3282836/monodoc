Earth is `exceeding` its “safe operating space for humanity” in six of nine key measurements of its health, and two of the remaining three are headed in the wrong direction, a new study said. Earth’s climate, `biodiversity`, land, freshwater, `nutrient` pollution and “`novel`” chemicals (human-made `compounds` like microplastics and nuclear waste) are all out of `whack`, a group of international scientists said in Wednesday’s journal Science Advances. Only the `acidity` of the oceans, the health of the air and the `ozone` layer are within the `boundaries` considered safe, and both ocean and air pollution are heading in the wrong direction, the study said.
