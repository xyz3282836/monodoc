The `Duke` and `Duchess` of Sussex and the duchess’s mother were involved in a “near catastrophic” two-hour car `chase` in New York after being followed by “a ring of highly `aggressive` `paparazzi`”, the `duke`’s spokesperson has said. The incident is said to have happened after Prince Harry, Meghan and her mother, Doria Ragland, attended an awards ceremony on Tuesday. The three of them are said to have been subjected to a “`relentless` `pursuit`” involving half a dozen blacked-out vehicles.
