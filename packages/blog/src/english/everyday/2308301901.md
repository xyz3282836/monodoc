Ultra-processed food significantly raises the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attacks and `strokes`, according to two studies that one expert says should serve as a wake-up call for governments worldwide. Global consumption of heavily processed items such as `cereals`, `protein` bars, `fizzy` drinks, ready `meals` and fast food has soared in recent years. In the UK and US, well over half the average diet now consists of ultra-processed food (UPF). For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet `comprising` as much as 80% UPF is typical.
