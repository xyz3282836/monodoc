Former president Donald Trump said Thursday night that he’s been charged by the Justice Department in connection with the discovery that hundreds of classified documents were taken to his Mar-a-Lago home after he left the White House — a `seismic` event in the nation’s political and `legal` history. A seven-count indictment has been filed in `federal` court naming the former president as a criminal `defendant`, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of `anonymity` to describe a case that has yet to be `unsealed`.
