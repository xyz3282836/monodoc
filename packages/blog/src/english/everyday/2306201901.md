At least 96 people died in two of India’s most populous states over the last several days, officials said Sunday, with `swaths` of the country `reeling` from a `sweltering` heat wave. The deaths happened in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and eastern Bihar where authorities warned residents over 60 and others suffering various `maladies` to stay indoors during the daytime.
