The spotless baby giraffe believed to be the only of its kind has been finally given a name: Kipekee. Her `moniker`, said to mean "unique" in Swahili, was announced on the Today show Tuesday by David Bright, director of the Brights Zoo in Tennessee. Approximately 40,000 people from across the world had `voted` to name the 5-week-old animal, the NBC morning show said, with Kipekee getting 36% of the vote. "From a lot of guests we talked to, that was the easiest name for a child to say," Bright joked.
