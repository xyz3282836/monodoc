`Homicide` detectives are still trying to work out if a suspected mushroom poisoning, which killed three people, is `suspicious` or not. Heather Wilkinson, a local teacher; her sister, Gail Patterson; and Patterson's husband Don Patterson all died after eating toxic wild mushrooms in Leongatha Victoria's `Gippsland` region on July 29. A fourth person, Reverend Ian Wilkinson, who is a `pastor` at Korumburra Baptist Church and Heather Wilkinson's husband, is fighting for life in hospital after also eating the mushrooms at the same meal. Detective Inspector Dean Thomas told media the investigation was "complex" but confirmed a family member was a suspect.
