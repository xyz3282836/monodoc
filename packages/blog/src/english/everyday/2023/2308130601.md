Hangzhou announced on Monday that, starting Sept. 10, couples having a third child may receive a one-time payment of 25,000 yuan ($3,466) in an effort to boost low birthrates in the city. The amount surpasses that handed out in Shenzhen to become one of the largest government payments for having children in China. Under the new policy, couples that have a third child may receive a childcare `allowance` of 20,000 yuan and a `maternity` allowance of 5,000 yuan. For those having a second child, the payments are 5,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan, `respectively`.
