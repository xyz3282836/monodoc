A `rescue` operation was underway deep in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean on Monday in search of a technologically advanced `submersible` `vessel` carrying five people to document the `wreckage` of the Titanic, the `iconic` ocean `liner` that `sank` more than a century ago. The vessel was reported `overdue` Sunday night about 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland, according to Canada’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
