Whether you’re `ticking` through tomorrow’s to-do list or `dwelling` on past `regrets`, it’s normal for worries and fears to surface at night, experts say. According to an October 2022 survey of 3,192 of adults in the United States, for instance, 34 percent of `respondents` reported feeling anxious or nervous within the past month. And 32 percent said that their stress had led to changes in their sleeping habits, including difficulties with falling asleep. There’s an evolutionary purpose to evening anxiety, said Dr. Rafael Pelayo, a `clinical` professor of `psychiatry` and behavioral sciences in sleep medicine.
