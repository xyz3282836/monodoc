Chinese coffee chain giant Luckin Coffee is set to reach 10,000 stores in the first half of this year, becoming the first coffee chain in China to do so, its CEO Guo Jinyi recently revealed. Founded in 2017, Luckin has had a `whirlwind` few years. Its `blockbuster` IPO in the United States just 19 months after its founding made it an investor `darling`, but `revelations` of accounting `fraud` forced it to `delist` in `disgrace` and enter into `bankruptcy` just a year later. After such huge `twists and turns`, many people are curious: How has Luckin brought about its latest `reversal` in fortune? The answer: selling coffee in China’s smaller cities.
