An Australian `sailor` who survived two months in the Pacific Ocean by eating raw fish and drinking rainwater is "stable and very well", a doctor says. Sydney `resident` Tim Shaddock, 51, and his dog Bella left Mexico for French Polynesia in April, but their boat was damaged by a storm several weeks later. They were rescued by a `trawler` this week after a `helicopter` `spotted` them. The doctor aboard the `tuna` trawler said that the man had "normal `vital` signs". Mr. Shaddock `embarked` on his more than 6,000km-long (3,728-mile) voyage from Mexico's city of La Paz - but soon became `stranded` after his vessel's electronics were cut off by bad weather.
