India launched its first space mission to study the sun on Saturday, less than two weeks after a successful `uncrewed` landing near the south `polar` region of the moon. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft took off on board a satellite launch vehicle from the Sriharikota space center in southern India on a `quest` to study the sun from a point about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. The point, known as L1, affords an uninterrupted view of the sun. The spacecraft is equipped with seven payloads to study the sun’s `corona`, `chromosphere`, `photosphere` and solar wind, the Indian Space Research Organization said.
