For years scientists have believed that when it comes to weight gain, all calories are created equal. But an `intriguing` new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that’s not true. The body appears to react differently to calories `ingested` from high-`fiber` whole foods vs. ultra-processed `junk` foods. The reason? Cheap processed foods are more quickly `absorbed` in your upper `gastrointestinal` tract, which means more calories for your body and fewer for your `gut` `microbiome`, which is located near the end of your `digestive` tract.
