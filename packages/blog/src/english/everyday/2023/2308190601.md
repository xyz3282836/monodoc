China Evergrande Group is seeking a U.S. court’s `approval` to restructure more than \$19 billion in the company’s `offshore` `debts`, as the embattled `property` developer pushes forward on plans to complete one of the world’s largest and most complex debt restructurings. China Evergrande, the world’s most indebted property developer, on Thursday `filed` for chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York. Court approval of the debt restructuring would make the deal legally binding in the U.S. and would close the door to any `disputes` against the plan that could be brought in America.
