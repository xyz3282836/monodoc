The US government conducted a “multi-decade” program which collected, and attempted to reverse-engineer, crashed UFOs, a former American intelligence official told a remarkable congressional hearing on Wednesday. David Grusch, who led analysis of unexplained `anomalous` phenomena (UAP) within a US Department of Defense agency until 2023, told the House oversight committee in Washington that “non-human” beings had been found, as the issue of alien life received its highest-profile `airing` to date. The hearing was prompted by claims from Grusch in June that the government was secretly `harboring` alien space craft. On Wednesday, Grusch repeated some of those claims – although not all – `under oath`.
