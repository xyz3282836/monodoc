The United Auto Workers and Detroit’s Big Three carmakers resumed talks aimed at ending a strike now in its fourth day, and under the threat that the `walkout` could soon spread. Stellantis said it resumed `negotiations` with the union Monday and described the talks as “constructive.” A spokesman for General Motors said `representatives` of the company and the United Auto Workers also were continuing to negotiate. However, UAW President Shawn Fain said on NPR, “We have a long way to go,” and if the companies don’t respond to the union’s demands, “then we will `escalate` action.”
