Japan began releasing water from its `crippled` Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean Thursday over the `objections` of local fishermen and the government of neighboring China. The move has led to criticism, particularly from fishermen, that the decision to release the water was made without enough public debate and input from Japan's northeast Tohoku region, despite its outsize contribution to the capital's supply of labor, seafood and energy. China announced a ban on imports of all `aquatic` products originating from Japan starting Thursday.
