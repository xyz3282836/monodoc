Zlatan Ibrahimovic has announced his `retirement` from football, at the age of 41. The Swedish superstar’s contract expires at the end of June and it will not be renewed following a season `plagued` by `injuries`, prompting him to end a remarkable and successful `career`. Ibrahimovic arrived in Milan for his second `spell` with the club in early 2020, having won the Scudetto with them in 2011, and helped them win the title again last season.
