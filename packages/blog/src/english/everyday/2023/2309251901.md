The discovery of ancient wooden logs in the banks of a river in Zambia has changed `archaeologists`' understanding of ancient human life. Researchers found evidence the wood had been used to build a structure almost half a million years ago. The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest stone-age people built what may have been `shelters`. "This find has changed how I think about our early `ancestors`," archaeologist Prof Larry Barham said. The University of Liverpool scientist leads the Deep Roots of Humanity research project, which `excavated` and analysed the ancient `timber`.
