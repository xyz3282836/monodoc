Morocco faces a race against time to save those trapped under the `rubble` by Friday's earthquake, as emergency services battle to supply remote areas. `Villagers` continue to dig by hand and shovel to find survivors, as response teams struggle to bring in machinery. Those same tools may now be needed to prepare `graves` for some of the thousands killed in the quake. Friday's earthquake, the country's deadliest for more than 60 years, struck below a remote cluster of mountainous villages south of Marrakesh. The government reported that at least 2,122 people were killed and more than 2,421 injured, many `critically`.
