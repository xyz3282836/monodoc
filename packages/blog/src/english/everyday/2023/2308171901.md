Two American tourists in Paris have been found sleeping inside the Eiffel Tower after getting stuck while drunk, according to `prosecutors`. The two men were found by security guards in the early hours of Monday. They paid to visit the landmark at around 22:40 on Sunday and `hopped` security barriers while coming down the `stairs`, police said. They were found in an area normally closed to the public between the tower's second and third levels. A specialist firefighter unit for rescuing people from heights were sent to recover the men.
