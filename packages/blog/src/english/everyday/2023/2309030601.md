Early human ancestors came close to `eradication` in a severe evolutionary `bottleneck` between 800,000 and 900,000 years ago, according to scientists. A `genomics` analysis of more than 3,000 living people suggested that our ancestors’ total population `plummeted` to about 1,280 `breeding` `individuals` for about 117,000 years. Scientists believe that an extreme climate event could have led to the bottleneck that came close to wiping out our ancestral line. “The numbers that emerge from our study correspond to those of species that are currently at risk of extinction,” said Prof Giorgio Manzi, an `anthropologist` at Sapienza University of Rome and a senior author of the research.
