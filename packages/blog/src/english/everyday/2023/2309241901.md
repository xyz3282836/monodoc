Australia is set to `fulfil` student Swifties’ wildest dreams when it hosts an international academic `symposium` in 2024 `devoted` to the global cultural and economic impact of Taylor Swift. The three-day “Swiftposium”, hosted by the University of Melbourne from 11 to 13 February 2024, `coincides` with the singer’s Eras tour, which kicks off in Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 16 February. Organised by `scholars` from seven Australian and New Zealand universities, Swiftposium is billed as an “academic conference for scholars to `engage` in `critical` `dialogue` about Swift’s popularity and its `profound` `implications` for a range of issues including gender, `fandom`, popular culture, literature, the economy, the music industry, and more”.
