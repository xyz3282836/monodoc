Spotify spent more than \$1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck `splashy` deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid \$286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent \$250,000 and more an `episode` on exclusive shows to `lure` new listeners. The bet hasn’t paid off. Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about \$565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.
