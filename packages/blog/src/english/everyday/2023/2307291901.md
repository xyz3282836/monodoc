One of Britain’s biggest care home companies employed an 80-year-old senior nurse in a short-staffed care home who was older than some residents and not strong enough to help lift them. HC-One employed the `octogenarian` at Tower Bridge Care Centre, which was found by inspectors to be “`inadequate`” and “not safe”, in a case that highlights a `chronic` shortage of care workers across the UK. The woman’s role emerged when she failed to call 999 as required after an 83-year-old resident with dementia, Josephine Coggins, suffered an unexplained head injury, which later resulted in `admission` to hospital where she later died with `pneumonia`.
