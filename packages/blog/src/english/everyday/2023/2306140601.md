Netflix’s long-awaited crackdown on password-sharing in the U.S. `delivered` a `windfall` of new subscribers in its earliest days, according to new data, a sign that the move is bearing fruit despite being unpopular with many users. According to streaming analytics company Antenna, the streaming giant `amassed` more new subscriptions in the U.S. between May 25 and 28, shortly after Netflix notified users of the limits, than in any other four-day period since Antenna began compiling such data in 2019.
