Nine passengers were injured after an engine fire sent smoke into the `cabin` of an Air China `jetliner` landing in Singapore, prompting an `evacuation` of the aircraft. The Airbus A320 with 146 passengers and nine crew made an emergency landing about 4:15 p.m. Sunday, Changi Airport said in a statement on its Facebook page. The flight was coming from the city of Chengdu in China’s Sichuan province. Nine people had `minor` injuries related to smoke `inhalation` and `abrasions` during the evacuation, the statement said.
