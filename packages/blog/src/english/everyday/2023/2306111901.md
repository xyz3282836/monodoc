Social media users are sharing a surprisingly effective way to protect yourself indoors from the toxic wildfire smoke `blanketing` much of the East `Coast`: a box `fan`, four air filters and a whole lot of `duct` `tape`. As searches for “air purifiers” `spike` on Google, people are posting on TikTok and Facebook about how to build the DIY air purifier. The technique, known as the Corsi-Rosenthal method, has gained attention in recent years amid the pandemic and `raging` western U.S. wildfires.
