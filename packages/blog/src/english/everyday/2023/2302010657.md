Chinese mainland stocks mounted a remarkable rally on Monday, the first trading day of the year of the Rabbit, with a benchmark surging to a near bull market, despite a pullback later in the session, as market sentiments are evidently buoyed by a better-than-expected travel and spending spree during the Spring Festival holidays. Further highlighting the growing optimism for a solid recovery in the world's second-largest economy, overseas capital also continued to pour into the Chinese mainland stock market on Monday, with daily inflows hitting the highest level in over a year and monthly inflows on track for a fresh record.

周一，在兔年的第一个交易日，中国大陆的股票明显地扭转颓势，开始上涨，尽管在开盘的后半段有所回落，其基准值仍上涨到接近牛市的水平。这是因为市场的情绪似乎被春节假期期间高于预期的旅游和消费狂潮带动起来。周一，海外资本也在持续地为中国大陆的股票市场做出投资，其日流入金额已经达到了一年以来的最高值，月流入金额正在迈向一个全新的纪录，进一步佐证了对世界第二经济体经济稳定恢复的逐渐乐观。
