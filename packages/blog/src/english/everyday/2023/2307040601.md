The grandmother of a teenage boy, whose fatal shooting by police sparked five nights of `rioting` in France, has called for calm as authorities said the `scale` and `intensity` of the violence appeared to be `waning`, despite an `arson` attempt on a `mayor`’s home. Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, said the police deployment would be unchanged, with 45,000 officers on duty around the country, after `protesters` again `torched` cars, `looted` shops, damaged infrastructure and `clashed` with police on Saturday night.
