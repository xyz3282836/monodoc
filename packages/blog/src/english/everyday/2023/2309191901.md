Princess Diana's `sweater` featuring a black sheep among rows of white ones has sold for \$1.14 million (£920,000) at an `auction` by Sotheby's in New York. Bidding opened 31 August, and the top bid stayed under \$200,000 (£161,000) until the auction's final minutes. Sotheby's had estimated the value of the "sheep jumper" at \$50,000 to $80,000 (£40,300 to £64,500). It did not `disclose` the identity of the winning bidder. The simple piece of `knitwear`, which was unearthed in an `attic` in March, commanded a higher price than many other objects `tied` to the "People's Princess" that were sold at auctions in recent years.
