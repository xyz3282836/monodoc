Everything Everywhere All at Once `reigned` supreme at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards, winning four major awards and breaking the record for most wins for a single film. The `multiverse` `fantasy` film picked up the night’s biggest award for `ensemble` in a motion picture, female actor for Michelle Yeoh and both supporting actor awards, for Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan. “I think if I speak, my heart will explode,” Yeoh said at the start of her emotional speech, “This is not just for me, this is for every girl who looks like me,” she said. “Thank you for giving me a seat at the table.”
