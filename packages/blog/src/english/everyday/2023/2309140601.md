Apple has confirmed its new iPhone will not feature its `proprietary` lightning charging port, after the EU forced the change. The tech giant said that the iPhone 15, unveiled at its annual event on Tuesday, would use a USB-C cable as the "`universally` accepted standard". A new Apple Watch series was also unveiled with a more advanced chip. The new iPhone `handset`, which goes on sale next week, is the first since 2012 to feature an `alternative` charging port. The firm said the USB-C cable - which already works with many Apple laptops and iPads - will also work on new versions of its AirPods Pro earphones and wired EarPods headphones.
