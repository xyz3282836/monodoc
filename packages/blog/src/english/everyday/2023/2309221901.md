A `surge` in demand for `liquor`-filled chocolates launched by Kweichow Moutai in `collaboration` with Mars Inc.-owned Dove has driven prices up by as much as 180% on the second-hand trading platform Xianyu. Originally priced at 35 yuan ($4.80), a box of two chocolates, sold under the name Maoxiaoling, can now fetch up to 99.99 yuan. Responding to the `overwhelming` demand, Kweichow Moutai — China’s leading liquor brand — announced that it is boosting production and strongly advised consumers to only buy the chocolates from official stores. Kweichow Moutai unveiled the liquor-filled chocolates on Sept. 16, shortly after launching an `alcoholic` coffee drink in partnership with Luckin Coffee earlier this month.
