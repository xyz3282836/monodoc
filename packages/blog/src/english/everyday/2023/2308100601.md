India's space agency has released the first images of the Moon taken by the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which entered `lunar` orbit on Saturday. The images show `craters` on lunar surface getting larger and larger as the spacecraft draws closer. Chandrayaan-3's lander and `rover` are due to reach the surface on 23 August. If successful, India will be the first country to perform a controlled "soft landing" near the south `pole`. It will also become only the fourth to achieve a soft landing on the Moon.
