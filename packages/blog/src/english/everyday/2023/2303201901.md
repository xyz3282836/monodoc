Space is getting a new look — sort of. On Wednesday, just a week after the end of the Paris fashion collections and with the sort of `sonic` `crescendo` attached to the most `extravagant` runway shows, NASA `unveiled` the new Artemis III lunar spacesuit at Space Center Houston. Which is to say, the first real reconsideration of the spacesuit in 40 years. Unlike the spacesuit redesigns of private companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the Artemis III spacesuit is not meant to be `worn` `solely` within a spacecraft but on the surface of the moon too, specifically the never-before-visited lunar south `pole`.
