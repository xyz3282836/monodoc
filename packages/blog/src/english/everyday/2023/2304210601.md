India is poised to `overtake` China as the world's most populous nation, with almost 3 million more people than its neighbour by the middle of this year, data released on Wednesday by the United Nations showed. India's population by mid-year is `estimated` at 1.4286 billion, against 1.4257 billion for China - 2.9 million fewer - in the United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) "State of World Population Report" for this year. The United States is a distant third, with an estimated population of 340 million as of the end of June.
