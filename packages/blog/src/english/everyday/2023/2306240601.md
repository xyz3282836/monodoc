Lionel Messi will make his Inter Miami debut on 21 July, according to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Mas said the Argentinian will play in his new club’s Leagues Cup meeting with Liga MX’s Cruz Azul. The match is set for DRV PNK Stadium, the team’s temporary home in Fort Lauderdale while it searches for a `permanent` stadium in Miami. Mas said the club intends to have a permanent stadium by 2025. Messi’s contract is for two-and-a-half years, meaning he could play in the new `venue`.
