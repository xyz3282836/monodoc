Officials in Hawaii have urged tourists to avoid traveling to Maui, as many hotels prepared to house `evacuees` and first responders on the island after wildfires killed more than 90 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. About 46,000 residents and visitors have `flown` out of Kahului Airport in West Maui since the scale of the `devastation` in the historic town of Lahaina became `clear` on Wednesday, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. “In the weeks ahead, the collective resources and attention of the federal, state and county government, the West Maui community, and the travel industry must be focused on the recovery of residents who were forced to `evacuate` their homes and businesses,” the agency said in a statement late Saturday.
