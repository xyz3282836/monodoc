A former employee of Amazon’s Ring doorbell camera unit spied on female customers for months in 2017 with cameras placed in bedrooms and bathrooms, the Federal Trade Commission said in a `court` `filing` on Wednesday when it announced a $5.8m `settlement` with the company over privacy `violations`. Amazon also agreed to pay $25m to settle `allegations` it violated children’s privacy rights when it failed to delete Alexa recordings at the request of parents and kept them longer than necessary, according to a court filing in federal court in Seattle that `outlined` a separate settlement.
