A jury found Donald Trump `liable` Tuesday for sexually `abusing` advice `columnist` E. Jean Carroll in 1996, `awarding` her $5 million in a judgment that could `haunt` the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House. The `verdict` was split: Jurors rejected Carroll’s claim that she was `raped`, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judgment adds to Trump’s legal `woes` and offers `vindication` to Carroll, whose `allegations` had been `mocked` and `dismissed` by Trump for years.
