New research suggests humans lived in South America at the same time as now `extinct` giant `sloths`, bolstering evidence that people arrived in the Americas earlier than once thought. Scientists analyzed `triangular` and teardrop-shaped `pendants` made of `bony` material from the sloths. They concluded that the `carved` and `polished` shapes and `drilled` holes were the work of `deliberate` craftsmanship. Dating of the `ornaments` and `sediment` at the Brazil site where they were found point to an age of 25,000 to 27,000 years ago, the researchers reported. That’s several thousand years before some earlier theories had suggested the first people arrived in the Americas, after migrating out from Africa and then Eurasia.
