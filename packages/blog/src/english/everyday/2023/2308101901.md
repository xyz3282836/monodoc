Six travel agencies in Beijing were suspended for scalping tickets to `the Forbidden City` on Wednesday. This marks the first major enforcement action after the country’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued new guidelines `cracking down` on tourist site scalpers in late July. Tourism ticket scalping has been a long-standing problem in China, especially during the summer when demand for tickets to major tourist attractions is highest. According to `preliminary` research by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's data center, this year's summer tourism may achieve a market share of 27-30% for the year.
