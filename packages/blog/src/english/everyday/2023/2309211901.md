An almost complete dinosaur `skeleton` will be sold at auction in Paris next month. The 150 million-year-old `camptosaurus` was discovered in the 1990s in the US state of Wyoming. It was named Barry after Barry James, the `palaeontologist` who found it. Experts say the skeleton is "extremely well preserved". It is expected to fetch up to €1.2m in an auction at Hotel Drouot on 20 October. Barry dates back to the late Jurassic period and measures 2.1m tall and 5m long. Alexandre Giquello, from the auction house Hotel Drouot, said it was unusual to see a dinosaur skeleton so `intact`.
