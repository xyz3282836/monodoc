Education experts in China are calling for better career development for `vocational` teachers after a new `survey` found that many teachers still suffer from a lack of career development opportunities despite a strong `desire` for growth. The survey, conducted by the state-run Educator magazine and various Chinese education research `institutes`, has found that “`insufficient` attention is being paid to the improvement of teachers’ academic qualifications and professional development,” especially for younger teachers. The survey of vocational teachers nationwide, including those working in universities, junior colleges, and secondary schools, was conducted online from April to July, with 15,724 respondents. There are over 1.36 million vocational teachers in China.
