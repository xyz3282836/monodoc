From using dead spiders to `grip` objects to `probing` the `weird` feeling that occurs when the same word is written over and over again, researchers `investigating` some of the `quirkiest` `conundrums` in `science` have been honoured in this year’s Ig Nobel prizes. Unlike the rather more stately Nobel prizes – which will be announced next month – the Ig Nobel prizes celebrate unusual areas of research that “make people laugh, then think”. They also come with a rather less `majestic` `cheque`: this year’s winning teams will each receive a 10 trillion dollar bill … from Zimbabwe.
