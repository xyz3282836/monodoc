A Tencent programmer has been arrested in Beijing for operating a platform rating students’ appearances for several years, using a database stolen from Renmin University in Beijing. Ma Zhengyi, 25, `allegedly` hacked into his `alma` `mater`’s student database and created an online platform to rate students’ appearances based on their official school photo. His social media posts from 2020 suggest the platform has existed for around three years.
