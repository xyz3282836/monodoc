For the first time in history, giant panda remains have been unearthed from a royal `burial` `pit` dating back to the Western Han Dynasty (202BC-AD25), which was released in a documentary that aired on Saturday. A complete `skeleton` of an animal, which was later confirmed to be that of a giant panda, was discovered by `archaeologists` at the end of 2021 during an `excavation` of more than 20 small `subsidiary` pits around the grand `mausoleum` of Emperor Wendi of Han in the `outskirts` of Xi'an, capital city of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, according to a report by the news website cover.cn on Tuesday.
