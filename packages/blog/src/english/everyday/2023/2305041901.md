In 1949, the new government of China declared May 4 National Youth Day to `preserve` and develop the spirit of `patriotism` and `democracy` of the May Fourth Movement. Since then, all kinds of `commemorative` activities are held annually across the country. Many young people `participate` in `volunteering` activities and social practices. Some places hold coming-of age ceremonies for young adults on Youth Day.
