Many people `slather` on `serums` and `lotions` in the hope of achieving fresher, younger skin. But for surprisingly effective results, try lifting weights. A new study published in Scientific Reports found that both `aerobic` exercise and weight training `altered` `gene` expression and improved the underlying health of `facial` skin cells and `tissue`. However, resistance workouts produced benefits beyond those of the `endurance` exercise. The findings “add to the evidence supporting that exercise” of any kind “is beneficial to skin health,” said Mark Tarnopolsky, a professor, physician and director of the `Neuromuscular` and `Neurometabolic` `Clinic` at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.
