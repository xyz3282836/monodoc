A first edition copy of JRR Tolkien’s The Hobbit has sold for more than £10,000 after being discovered in a `charity` shop. The rare copy of Bilbo Baggins’ `tale` was `stumbled` upon by a manager of the Cancer Research UK superstore in Dundee. As the store only sells items for £5 or less, the book was put up for sale on eBay, where it made £10,099.50 for the charity. The book is one of the first 1,500 copies of the children’s literature classic, which sold out soon after publication in 1937 due to `rave` reviews. These editions include black and white `illustrations` by Tolkien himself.
