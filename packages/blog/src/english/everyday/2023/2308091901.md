More than 10% of the seafood sold in Australia is not what’s on the label and threatened species sometimes `wind` up on the plate, DNA tests suggest. The national study, by the Minderoo Foundation, has exposed a serious problem with labelling and species `substitution`. Researchers who DNA tested 672 seafood products sold at Australian supermarkets, fish markets and restaurants found 11.8% didn’t match what was on the label. Shark and `snapper` species, and imported seafood, were most likely to be incorrectly labelled.
