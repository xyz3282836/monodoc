Construction for a Beijing base of the China `Conservation` and Research Center for Giant Panda is currently underway in the capital's Fangshan district, according to a `press` `conference` by the Information Office of Beijing `Municipality` on Wednesday. The Beijing base project covers an area of about 2,000 acres. It is expected to be completed in 2024 and will be home to 50 giant pandas. This "home for giant pandas in Beijing" is located in Qinglong Lake Town in Fangshan district. It takes about 40 minutes to reach the town from the city's West Second Ring Road.
