As the first romantic holiday after China optimized its COVID-19 response, the Valentine's Day this year has witnessed a surge in spending on flowers, gifts and catering, evidence that consumption and business activities are recovering faster than expected from the pandemic. Flowers are the Valentine's Day staple, and both sales and prices are up, the Global Times learned from traders. A flower wholesaler in Kunming, Yunnan Province, which is a major flower trading and distribution hub in China, said that her recent daily sales of flowers surged to 50,000 compared with 10,000 for normal days.

作为中国优化新冠肺炎疫情防控政策后的第一个浪漫节日，今年的情人节见证了鲜花、礼品和餐饮消费的激增，这证明消费和商业活动从新冠疫情中恢复得比预期还要迅速。《环球时报》从经销商那里了解到，鲜花作为情人节的主打产品，其销量和价格都在上升。 中国鲜花贸易与分销枢纽——云南省昆明市的一位鲜花批发商说，她最近的鲜花日销量猛增到 5 万支，而平时只有 1 万支。
