A female `reticulated` giraffe was born at Brights Zoo in northeastern Tennessee late last month — but unlike her mother she was born without any spots, a rarity. Standing 14 to 15 feet tall, giraffes are the tallest `mammals` in the world. When mothers give birth, the `calves` are already 6 feet tall, and other than on especially rare occasions, they're born covered from `hoof` to `horn` in brown spots. Brights Zoo announced that it welcomed the birth of a reticulated giraffe without any spots on July 31. "Giraffe experts believe she is the only solid-colored reticulated giraffe living anywhere on the planet," said the zoo.
