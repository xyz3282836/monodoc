There could be a new `contender` for heaviest animal to ever live. While today’s blue `whale` has long held the title, scientists have `dug` up fossils from an ancient giant that could tip the scales. Researchers described the species — named Perucetus colossus, or “the `colossal` whale from Peru” — in the journal Nature on Wednesday. Each `vertebra` weighs over 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and its `ribs` measure nearly 5 feet (1.4 meters) long. “It’s just exciting to see such a giant animal that’s so different from anything we know,” said Hans Thewissen, a `paleontologist` at Northeast Ohio Medical University.
