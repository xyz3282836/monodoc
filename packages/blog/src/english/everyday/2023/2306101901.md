Imagine your workplace software could help you do a better job. It might provide feedback on your client `interactions` and tell you how to `seal` the deal. Perhaps it could teach you how to reduce stress at work. Or maybe it could `sense` when you’re feeling `isolated` and help you reconnect with your `colleagues`. Would that be helpful, or too much? Some software providers and start-ups are `banking` on the former, `promoting` work tools that use data to `combat` `burnout`, reduce stress levels, and boost productivity and engagement.
