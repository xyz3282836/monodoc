In the `aspirational` world of luxury, affordability is a `tough` sell. Of course, that wasn’t the reason that Coach owner Tapestry gave for `pursuing` an acquisition of Capri Holdings, which owns accessibly priced Michael Kors, as well as high-end brands Versace and Jimmy Choo. But growth in the less-expensive luxury category has `undeniably` `lagged` behind the `lofty` growth experienced by high-end `peers`. And with its core customers—those with incomes comfortably above the national median but far below the top 1%—feeling `squeezed`, growth looks difficult without scale.
