The second solar term of the summer, Xiaoman, falls on Saturday. It is also the eighth of the 24 solar terms of a year, according to the Chinese `lunar` calendar of the year. Just like its English name “Grain Buds”, Xiaoman is the `subtle` period of time when the grains are about to ripen but are not quite there yet. If the rainfall is sufficient, the following season of rice planting is guaranteed.
