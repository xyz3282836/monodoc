Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger `vowed` to make its streaming services profitable via a planned October price `hike` on its ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans and a `crackdown` on password sharing expected to extend through next year. The increases will raise the monthly cost of ad-free Disney+ by \$3, or roughly 27%, to almost \$14. The cost of ad-free Hulu will `likewise` rise \$3 to almost \$18 — a 20% hike that will make it more expensive than the most popular ad-free tier at Netflix.
