Scooter isn't what many would call a `conventional` beauty. The 7-year-old `Chinese Crested dog`, with reversed hind legs, is nearly `bald` but for a shock of white `wispy` hairs. But it's those kinds of `peculiarities` that `endeared` the `pooch` to `judges` at the "World's Ugliest Dog" `contest` in Petaluma, Calif., where he took home the grand prize on Friday. Scooter's pink, `wayward` tongue may be `drooping` from his mouth. The contest's title, however, is meant to be `tongue-in-cheek`. The nearly 50-year-old event is held to show that these dogs are uniquely beautiful by celebrating "the `imperfections` that make all dogs special," and to `advocate` for `adoption`.
