“I was born for drama,” Sifan Hassan declared after one of the most extraordinary races `veered` from her almost stopping – and nearly being run over by a `motorcycle` – to a victory that `cemented` her place among the all-time greats. Hassan, a world and Olympic champion at distances ranging from 1,500 to 10,000 metres, had never previously run the 26.2-mile marathon distance and had looked certain to `pull out` in the first half after stopping several times due to a `hip` `injury`.
