As Hurricane Franklin was `barreling` toward the Eastern United States last month, the United States `Coast` `Guard`, preparing off the coast of Georgia, encountered another unexpected phenomenon. Alone at sea was a man in a buoyant human-size hamster wheel who claimed he was trying to journey on the Atlantic Ocean. Again. The man, Reza Baluchi, 51, of Florida, told officers he had planned to travel more than 4,000 miles to London in the homemade vessel. Mr. Baluchi, who has been attempting similar `voyages` since 2014, threatened to kill himself should officers interrupt his mission, the Coast Guard said.
