Starbucks reported record revenue in its `fiscal` third quarter as its China business `roared` back to life. Still, the company’s results were mixed for the 13 weeks ending July 2. While its earnings surpassed Wall Street’s forecast, its revenue and same-store sales were lower than expected as North American store traffic slowed. Starbucks shares were down 1% in after-market trading Tuesday. Same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — jumped 46% in China. At Chinese stores opened in 2019 or earlier, morning `routines` are fully back to 2019 levels, the company said.
