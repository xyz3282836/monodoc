Former President Donald Trump returned to New York on Monday to face his historic booking and `arraignment` on `hush` money charges related to `allegations` of sexual encounters. The nation’s largest city `bolstered` security. Upon arrival at New York’s LaGuardia airport, Trump stepped off his jet alone and directly into a waiting black SUV, with no one `greeting` him. Only small, `sparse` groups of supporters lined the route as his `motorcade` used a police `escort` to `whisk` him into Manhattan. From the air, the `procession` `conjured` images of a current president on the move rather than a former one facing criminal charges.
