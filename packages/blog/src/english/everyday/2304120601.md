European leaders were `wrapping` up their three-day visit to China after Chinese and French top leaders met for informal talks in southern China's Guangzhou on Friday, marking the `climax` in high-level interactions between China and Europe. The visit also helped stabilize relations amid growing `turbulence` and uncertainties that the world is facing and reset the cooperation as well as face-to-face interaction, as China reached some `consensus` with both France and the EU on major global and regional issues.
