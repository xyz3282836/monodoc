It is a holiday `tale` designed to `court` `outrage`: a tourist in a cafe in Italy has been charged an extra €2 for the `privilege` of having his sandwich cut in half. The customer just wanted to share the sandwich with his girlfriend, but when the bill arrived it listed the mysterious service “diviso a metà” at the price of €2. A snapshot of the `receipt` went `viral`, prompting Italian newspapers to question the owner of the cafe – Bar Pace in Lake Como – who defended the `surcharge`. “To cut it in half took us some time, and work must be paid for,” she said.
