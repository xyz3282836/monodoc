Two months ago, Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit Inc. was `poised` to make history delivering the first satellites into orbit from the billionaire’s home country of the U.K. That high-profile launch from Cornwall, England, went badly, ending in the destruction of its satellite payload and triggering a `probe` into what went wrong. Now, Virgin Orbit is in talks with two `financial` `institutions` about a `bailout` and has `furloughed` staff. Late Thursday, after disclosing its operational pause, Virgin Orbit—which listed less than two years ago at a `valuation` of more than $3 billion—fell more than 30%.
