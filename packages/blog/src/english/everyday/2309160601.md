A Mexican `journalist` and self-`proclaimed` “ufologist” presented what he said were thousand-year-old “non-human” `corpses` to Mexico’s `Congress`, unveiling two `scrawny`, cartoonlike bodies during a hearing on Tuesday. “This is the first time [`extraterrestrial` life] is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear `demonstration` that we are dealing with nonhuman `specimens` that are not related to any other species in our world,” Jaime Maussan told lawmakers, speaking under `oath`. “We are not alone.” The tiny `alleged` aliens, which lay in two boxes during the hearing, are likely about 1,000 years old, according to analyses conducted by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, he said. The bodies were recovered underground in Peru in 2017 and found wrapped in `algae`, which helped preserve them, he said.
