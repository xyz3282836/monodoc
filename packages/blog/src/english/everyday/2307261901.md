This summer brings a new way to deal with grief. It’s not a helpline or a new `antidepressant` – instead artist Annie Frost Nicholson has created a disco where you can dance away your existential pain. The Fandangoe Discoteca, a brightly coloured `kiosk` whose design is inspired by De Stijl and `postmodernist` `architect` Ettore Sottsass and which holds up to eight dancers, arrives at London’s Canary `Wharf` this month before touring the UK and Europe over the summer. As well as DJ sets, there’ll be `meditation` and yoga workshops, dance classes and “grief raves” where clubbers can request tracks which remind them of `absent` or lost loved ones.
