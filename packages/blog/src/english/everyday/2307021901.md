If you’ve always dreamt of a life that’s `plastic`, fantastic and pink all over, your `prayers` have been answered by Airbnb. Beginning in mid-July, ahead of the `premiere` of the Barbie movie, Barbie fans can book a stay in Ken’s bedroom in Barbie’s oceanside `mansion` in Malibu, California. Though it’s `technically` Barbie’s `property`, her longtime partner, Ken, is the host, according to the Airbnb listing. And he’s left personal `touches` like a grill, pool floaties that spell his name and a `barrel` of workout supplements called “Beefy body brine” for guests to enjoy.
