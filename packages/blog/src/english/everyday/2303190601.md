Markets were `upended` on Wednesday as investors’ fears over the health of the banking industry `resurfaced` and spread around the world, `reversing` some of the `rally` on Tuesday when the panic appeared to pause. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 percent at the close of trading, `recovering` some ground after a sharper drop earlier in the day. European markets were hard hit, with stocks of many of the region’s biggest banks falling sharply, as `anxiety` persisted about the `fallout` from the `collapse` of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which were `seized` by `regulators` after suffering `devastating` runs on `deposits`.
