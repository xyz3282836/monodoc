Facebook parent Meta is `slashing` 10,000 jobs, about as many as the social media company announced late last year in its first round of cuts, as uncertainly about the global economy hits the technology `sector` particularly hard. The company announced 11,000 job cuts in November, about 13% of its `workforce` at the time. In addition to the `layoffs`, Meta said Tuesday that it would not fill 5,000 open positions. “This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
