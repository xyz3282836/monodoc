The discovery of two cases of bird flu within the same family in Cambodia has highlighted the concern over `potential` human-to-human spread of the virus, although experts have stressed the risk `remains` low. On Thursday, Cambodian `authorities` reported an 11-year-old girl from Prey Veng province had died from H5N1, with `subsequent` testing of 12 of her contacts `revealing` that her father also had the virus. The World Health Organization said on Friday that increasing reports of bird flu in humans are “worrying”.
