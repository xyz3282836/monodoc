`Winking`, `grimacing` or `nodding` their heads, robots `mimicked` the expressions of visitors at a robot `expo` in Beijing. They were among the creations `dazzling` people attending the annual World Robot Conference, where companies showed off robots designed for a wide range of uses, including `manufacturing`, surgery and companionship. The `animatronic` heads and humanoid robots on display at the EX Robots `booth` this week `personified` the image of what robots are supposed to be in the popular imagination, with synthetic skin and lifelike `facial` expressions.
