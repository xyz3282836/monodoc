A solar storm forecast for Thursday is expected to give `skygazers` in 17 American states a chance to `glimpse` the Northern Lights, the colorful sky show that happens when solar wind hits the atmosphere. Northern Lights, also known as `aurora` `borealis`, are most often seen in Alaska, Canada and Scandinavia, but an 11-year solar cycle that’s expected to peak in 2024 is making the lights visible in places farther to the south. Three months ago, the light displays were visible in Arizona, marking the third `severe` `geomagnetic` storm since the current solar cycle began in 2019.
