G League call-up Mac McClung may have "saved" the NBA Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday, but it now appears the NBA All-Star Game itself is in need of saving. Team Giannis defeated Team LeBron, 184-175, on Sunday in Salt Lake City in a game that more closely resembled a layup line or shooting practice than a competitive basketball game between the world's best athletes. The Elam Ending provided a bit of drama in the fourth quarter as Team LeBron attempted to erase a 19-point deficit, but the rest of the game lacked any sort of competitiveness or edge on the defensive end of the court.

G 联盟征召的麦克朗可能“拯救”了周六的 NBA 扣篮大赛，但现在看来 NBA 全明星赛本身也需要被拯救。周日在盐湖城，字母哥（Giannis）队以 184-175 击败了勒布朗队，这场比赛更像是一场上篮或投篮练习，而不是世界上最好球员间的篮球竞技赛。在第四节，当勒布朗队试图追平 19 分的分差时，伊拉姆结局（先达到 24 分分差的队伍获胜）提供了一点戏剧性，但比赛的其余部分非常缺乏竞争感，防守方队伍毫无锐气。
