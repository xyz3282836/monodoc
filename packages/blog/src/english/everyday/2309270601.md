NASA’s first asteroid samples fetched from deep space `parachuted` into the Utah desert Sunday to cap a seven-year journey. In a `flyby` of Earth, the Osiris-Rex spacecraft released the sample `capsule` from 63,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) out. The small capsule landed four hours later on a remote `expanse` of `military` land, as the mothership set off after another asteroid. “We have touchdown!” Mission Recovery Operations announced, immediately repeating the news since the landing occurred three minutes early. Officials later said the orange striped `parachute` opened four times higher than `anticipated` — around 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) — basing it on the `deceleration` rate.
