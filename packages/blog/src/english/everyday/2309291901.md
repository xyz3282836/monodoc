`Fried` chicken `coated` with `ground` Sichuan `peppercorn`; chili peppers sautéed with hot oil in the wok; then finally everything `tossed` together and topped up with chili peppers and `cilantro`. Wang Xueli carefully transferred the food onto a plate and `sprinkled` some `sesame` on top — the famous Sichuan `spicy` `popcorn` chicken dish was ready. Wang, 22, who lives in Suzhou in eastern Jiangsu province, was making her hometown classic — not to cure her homesickness, but for her customers, whose kitchen she was using. She is not a professional `chef`. In China’s `affluent` cities, amateur private chefs who cook up a storm in their customers’ own kitchen have become increasingly popular. On lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu, posts about such services have received nearly 35 million views.
