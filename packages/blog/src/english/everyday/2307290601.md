From `tasty` `hotpots` and `adorable` giant pandas to `intangible` cultural `heritage` performances and an `extravaganza` combining the sporting spirit with local culture, the 31st FISU Summer World University Games is not only a `grand` sporting event but also a `magnificent` stage for cultural exchanges, showcasing a more inclusive and colorful Chinese culture while world civilizations meet. The Global Times learned from authorities in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, that in addition to special activities and thematic art `exhibitions` in the Games Village, local authorities have also organized a series of cultural and tourism activities in the city, including 12 major events and more than 2,000 special related activities.
