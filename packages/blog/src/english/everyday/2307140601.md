Is non-English language music the future of the music business? Perhaps. The global music industry surpassed 1 trillion streams at the fastest pace, ever, in a `calendar` year, Luminate’s 2023 Midyear Report has found. The number was reached in three months, a full month faster than 2022. Global streams are also up 30.8% from last year, reflective of an increasingly international music marketplace. Additionally, Luminate found that two in five — or 40% — of U.S. music listeners enjoy music in a non-English language. According to the report, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Italian, German, and Arabic are the most popular languages for non-`Anglophonic` music among U.S. music listeners, with Latin `genres` and K-pop leading the charge.
