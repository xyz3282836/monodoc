Rupert Murdoch has `abruptly` ended his `engagement` with the wedding only months away, according to sources close to the 92-year-old media `mogul`. Vanity Fair reported the news about the four-times-married Fox Corporation chairman’s engagement to Ann Lesley Smith, 66, a former San Francisco police `chaplain` turned `conservative` radio host, which was reported only last month. The wedding was set for this summer, less than a year after Murdoch finalized his `divorce` from his fourth wife, the model Jerry Hall.
