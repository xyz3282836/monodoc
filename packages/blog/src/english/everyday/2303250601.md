The first year-over-year drop in home prices in more than a decade and a `dip` in `mortgage` rates `snapped` a yearlong `streak` of `declining` monthly home sales, showing the effects of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the housing market, `rose` 14.5% in February from the `prior` month, but were down 22.6% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Sales had decreased for 12 `consecutive` months through January.
