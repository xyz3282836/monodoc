When Alicia Griggs steps outside her `suburban` Fort Lauderdale home, Florida’s latest `invasive` `species` comes a-hoppin’ down the street: lionhead rabbits. The `bunnies`, which `sport` an impressive flowing `mane` around their heads, want the food Griggs carries. But she also represents their best chance of survival and moving where this domesticated `breed` belongs: inside homes, away from cars, cats, hawks, Florida heat and possibly government-hired `exterminators`. Griggs is `spearheading` efforts to raise the \$20,000 to \$40,000 it would cost for a rescue group to capture, `neuter`, `vaccinate`, `shelter` and then give away the estimated 60 to 100 lionheads now populating Jenada Isles, an 81-home community in Wilton Manors.
