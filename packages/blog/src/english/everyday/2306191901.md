The trouble with gardening on `roofs` often comes down to weight. There’s the load of the plants themselves, then there’s the growing medium in which they need to `stretch` their roots, plus the containers required to house them and the water to `hydrate` them. It can take a lot of engineering to make a green roof, well, green. So, how convenient would it be to have a plant that can grow on top of buildings on nothing but thin air? Lloyd Godman and Geoff Beech are showing that `tillandsias` will do just that. What’s more, these `epiphytic` `bromeliads` can provide shade, help combat pollution and offer a `spikey`, `silvery`, `intermittently` flowering visual appeal.
