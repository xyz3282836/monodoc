`Parasitic`, `elusive` and `emitting` an overwhelming `odour` of `putrefying` `flesh`, Rafflesia – often called the `corpse` flower – has `intrigued` `botanists` for centuries. Now, scientists are warning that it is at risk of extinction and calling for action to save it. The blooms of the Rafflesia have become famous for their odour of `decaying` meat, produced to attract flesh-eating flies. But the `genus` – which includes the largest flowers in the world, at more than a `metre` across – is at risk due to the destruction of forest habitats in south-east Asia. There are 42 species of Rafflesia, and researchers warn that all of them are under threat, with 25 classified as critically endangered and 15 as endangered.
