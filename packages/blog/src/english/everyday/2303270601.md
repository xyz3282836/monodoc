An `asteroid` big enough to wipe out a city will `zip` harmlessly between Earth and the moon’s orbit this weekend, missing both `celestial` bodies. Saturday’s close `encounter` will offer `astronomers` the chance to study a space `rock` from just over 100,000 miles (168,000 kilometers) away. That’s less than half the distance from here to the moon, making it visible through `binoculars` and small telescopes. While asteroid flybys are common, NASA said it’s rare for one so big to come so close — about once a decade.
