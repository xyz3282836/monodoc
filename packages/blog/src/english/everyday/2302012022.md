Elon Musk “doesn’t seem like” the right person to own Twitter, the social media platform’s co-founder has said, adding that improvements to morale and content policies at the business have been reversed under its new proprietor. In an interview with the Guardian, Biz Stone said positive changes he had helped oversee in recent years had been unwound by the Tesla chief executive. Stone said running social media companies is “not really a win-win situation … it’s always tough”, because “50% of the people are gonna be happy, 50% of people are gonna be upset with you”.

推特这一社交网络平台的联合创始人放言，埃隆·马斯克“不像是”可以执掌推特的正确人选，他还称在马斯克的掌权下，这家公司提升士气和内容管理原则均遭到了颠覆。在一次与《卫报》的采访中，Biz Stone 说近年来他所见证的一些积极转变被这个特斯拉 CEO 恢复旧貌。Stone 认为，运营社交媒体类的公司“并不能真正带来双赢……因为过程往往十分艰难”，因为一半的人会很开心，但另一半的人会觉得你很烦。”
