Nike is planning further price `hikes` over the next year despite efforts from many retailers—and itself—to use discounts to boost sales and cut `inventories` of `footwear`. The `sneaker` giant expects to increase prices by low single-digit percentages on average to help offset rising costs for everything from labor to logistics, Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said Thursday. The company also plans to continue increasing the share of products sold through its own channels instead of `wholesalers`.
