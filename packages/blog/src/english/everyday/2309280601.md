OpenAI’s ChatGPT is getting a major update that will enable the viral chatbot to have voice conversations with users and interact using images, moving it closer to popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like Apple’s Siri. The voice feature “opens doors to many creative and accessibility-focused applications”, OpenAI said in a blog post on Monday. Similar AI services like Siri, Google voice assistant and Amazon’s Alexa are `integrated` with the devices they run on and are often used to set alarms and reminders, and deliver information off the internet.
