Italian fashion label Prada is teaming up with China’s women’s national soccer team in another partnership with Chinese female `athletes`. The brand is further building its `portfolio` of sports partnerships at a time when another Prada celebrity brand `ambassador` is `embroiled` in a `high-profile` sex `scandal`. Prada announced the partnership on Monday, in which it will provide traveling and formal event `outfits` for the `squad` and staff to “give the team a modern and stylish appearance `off the field`.” The deal was announced as the women’s team set off for the FIFA Women’s World Cup beginning July 20 in Australia and New Zealand.
