A US citizen trapped in Turkey's third deepest cave for more than a week has been pulled to safety, rescuers say. More than 150 people were involved in efforts to save caver Mark Dickey after he developed stomach problems in the Morca Cave on 2 September. Organisers say it was one of the largest and most complicated underground rescues **ever** **mounted**. The lowest point of the Morca Cave, in a remote part of the south, reaches nearly 1.3km (0.8 miles) below ground. Mr Dickey was brought out of the cave at 00:37 local time, the Turkish Caving Federation announced on social media.
