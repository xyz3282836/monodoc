Several U.S. government agencies, including the Energy Department, have been hacked in a data-stealing `cyberattack` `exploiting` a software bug that had already `compromised` major businesses in the U.K. and elsewhere, U.S. officials said Thursday. While officials were still `investigating` the `intrusions`, they said none of the `pilfered` data had apparently been leaked online so far and that no `extortion` demands had been paid to the hackers.
