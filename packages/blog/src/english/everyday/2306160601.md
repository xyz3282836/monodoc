Artificial intelligence has been used to `extract` John Lennon’s voice from an old demo to create “the last Beatles record,” decades after the band broke up, Paul McCartney said Tuesday. McCartney, 80, told the BBC that the technology was used to separate the Beatles’ voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson’s 2021 `documentary` series, “The Beatles: Get Back.” The “new” song is set to be released later this year, he said.
