“Slow travel is about quality over `quantity`,” said Phil Dengler, a co-founder of travel information site The Vacationer. “It is also about `immersing` yourself in the local culture. Traditional `vacations` often involve seeing as many things as possible in a short time. While there is nothing wrong with that, it can feel very `superficial`. It can also feel `overwhelming` and not like the ideal relaxing vacation.” As the name suggests, slow travel generally `entails` slowing down and `savoring` each moment, rather than rushing to check off bucket list items.
