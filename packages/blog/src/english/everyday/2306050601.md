Top Unilever marketing executive Conny Braams will leave the business in August after 33 years with the company, the London-based packaged goods giant said. Braams, the company’s chief digital and commercial officer, `oversees` the company’s digital transformation, marketing and customer experience functions. The company plans to name an executive to fill the same role, a spokeswoman said. Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly will also leave Unilever, though not until May 2024.
