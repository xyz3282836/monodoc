Forecasters from the World `Meteorological` Organization are reporting increased chances that the global climate pattern known as El Niño will arrive by the end of summer. With it comes increased chances for hotter-than-normal temperatures in 2024. While there is not yet a clear picture of how strong the El Niño event will be or how long it might last, even a relatively `mild` one could affect `precipitation` and temperature patterns around the world.
