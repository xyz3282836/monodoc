Police near Toronto have warned drivers to keep their car windows closed after a truck `spilled` `crates` carrying five million bees on to a road. Halton regional police said they received a call about 6.15am on Wednesday reporting the bee crates had come loose from a truck and spilled on to a road in Burlington, Ontario. “We’re not sure how or what exactly took place but at some point the boxes containing bees or beehives `slid` off the trailer and spilled all over the road,” Constable Ryan Anderson, told CBC News.
