Consumers continue to `absorb` higher prices for `Pampers` `diapers` and `Tide` `detergent`, boosting quarterly sales and profit at Procter & Gamble Co. The company raised prices by about 10% across its various brands in the March quarter from a year earlier. It was the second `straight` quarter with a 10% year-over-year increase as the global company passed along higher costs and `widened` its profit `margins`. P&G, whose premium brands are often the `costliest` on store shelves, has been raising prices and largely `outpaced` `competitors` during the `pandemic`.
