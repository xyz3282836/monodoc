Adobe’s $20bn deal to `acquire` rival Figma is set to face a lengthy `antitrust` investigation in the EU, in the latest move that threatens the software giant’s attempt to `consolidate` the digital design market. According to four people with direct knowledge of the move, European antitrust regulators are preparing to launch a formal investigation into the acquisition later this year, over concerns the transaction will lead to less `innovation` and higher prices.
