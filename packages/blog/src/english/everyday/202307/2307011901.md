A man was seen on video carving the name of his girlfriend into the walls of the `Colosseum`, drawing `outrage` from the Italian culture minister, who said the `suspect` should be identified and `punished`. Videos showing the man in the act have been going `viral` since last week, according to Italy’s ANA news agency. The unidentified `tourist` `engraved` “Ivan+Haley 23” onto the almost 2,000-year-old structure in Rome. He could face up to five years in prison and a fine of about $16,400, ANA reported.
