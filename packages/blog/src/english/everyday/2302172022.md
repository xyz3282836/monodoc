Seven more people have been rescued eight days after a massive earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, but hopes of finding further survivors of what the World Health Organization called the worst natural disaster in 100 years in its 53-country Europe region are dwindling. As a UN aid convoy entered stricken north-west Syria through a new crossing, the combined death toll rose to nearly 38,000, including 31,974 in Turkey and at least 5,714 in rebel-held and government-controlled Syria – a figure that is expected to continue to increase.

土耳其和叙利亚发生大地震 8 天后，又有 7 人获救。不过，在这场被世卫组织称为欧洲 53 国百年来最严重的自然灾害中，找到更多幸存者的希望正在减少。 随着联合国援助车队通过一个新的过境点，进入受灾的叙利亚西北部，全部死亡人数上升至近 38,000 人，包括土耳其的 31,974 人和叙利亚的至少 5,714 人——预计这一数字将继续增加。
