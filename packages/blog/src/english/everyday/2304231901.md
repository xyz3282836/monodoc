Scientists believe they have discovered the `mechanism` for hair turning grey, which could help develop treatment to alter cells in order to reverse or `halt` the process. A new study suggests stem cells may get `stuck` as hair ages and lose their ability to `mature` and maintain hair colour. Certain `stem` cells – which are able to develop into many different cell types – have a unique ability to transition between growth `compartments` in `follicles`. These cells lose the ability to move with age, resulting in greyness.
