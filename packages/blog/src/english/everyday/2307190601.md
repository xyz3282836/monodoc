Actress and singer Jane Birkin, who `charmed` France with her English grace, style and `accented` French and made the country her home, has died at age 76, according to France's Culture Ministry and French media. The London-born star was widely `admired` for her fashion style and known for her musical and romantic relationship with French singer Serge Gainsbourg. Their songs notably included the `steamy` "Je t'aime moi non plus," with Birkin's `ethereal`, British-accented singing voice `interlacing` with his `gruff` `baritone`. Her many films included roles in 1966’s “Blow-Up” and 1978’s “Death on the Nile.” The star is famously known as the inspiration behind the Birkin bag, a designer `purse` made by Hermès.
