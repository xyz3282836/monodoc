Apple is testing the limits of how much people will pay for premium iPhones as it tries to drive revenue despite slowing global demand for smartphones. The tech company is expected by analysts to raise prices by as much as $100 for some updated models of its `flagship` device when it `unveils` the iPhone 15 at an annual `promotional` event set for Tuesday. Those new iPhone Pro models are expected to include `titanium` casing, improved processors and photography features. Potential price increases will help pay for growing component costs because of inflation, but some analysts have warned that the strategy will soon hit a `ceiling`.
