Shein, the online fashion company that won over millions of American shoppers during the pandemic, `raised` $2 billion in its latest `fundraising` round that values the company at $66 billion, about a third less than a year earlier, according to people close to the company. The online-only `retailer`, which was founded in China and is now based in Singapore, cut its `valuation` after tech-company share prices have come down. The company also faces `intensifying` pressure from U.S. `lawmakers` on its labor and environmental practices.
