Federal health officials have approved the first pill specifically intended to treat `severe` depression after childbirth, a condition that affects thousands of new mothers in the U.S. each year. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday granted approval of the drug, Zurzuvae, for adults experiencing severe depression related to childbirth or `pregnancy`. The pill is taken once a day for 14 days. “Having access to an `oral` medication will be a beneficial option for many of these women `coping` with extreme, and sometimes life-threatening, feelings,” said Dr. Tiffany Farchione, FDA’s director of `psychiatric` drugs, in a statement.
