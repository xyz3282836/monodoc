`Amidst` the continuing `fervor` for outdoor sports and activities like `frisbee`, `hiking`, or `camping`, China’s young generation now finds itself `irresistibly` drawn to a new trend — `lure` fishing. Unlike traditional `angling` methods, where real `bait` is used and often requires hours of waiting `patiently`, lure fishing takes a more active approach. Here, `anglers` use artificial bait and skillfully `mimic` the movements of smaller fish, `fooling` `aggressive` fish into thinking they are actually `prey`. According to the China Angling Association, 46% of the country’s 140 million anglers are aged between 25 and 44.
