A prominent Harvard physicist is planning a `Pacific` `expedition` to find what he thinks might be an alien `artefact` that `smashed` into the ocean. Avi Loeb announced that he is organizing a $1.5 million ocean expedition to Papua New Guinea to look for fragments of an object that crashed off the `coast` of its Manus Island in 2014. Loeb noticed the object in 2019 and identified it as the first `interstellar` `meteor` ever discovered – meaning it originated outside our `solar` system.
