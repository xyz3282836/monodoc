Solar power cells have raced past the key milestone of 30% energy efficiency, after `innovations` by multiple research groups around the world. The `feat` makes this a “revolutionary” year, according to one expert, and could accelerate the rollout of solar power. Today’s `solar panels` use silicon-based `cells` but are rapidly approaching their maximum conversion of sunlight to electricity of 29%. At the same time, the installation rate of solar power needs to increase `tenfold` in order to tackle the climate crisis, according to scientists.
