Shell has `abandoned` plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, in a shift in `approach` to `firmly` target fossil fuels and increase `payouts` to shareholders under its new chief executive. The oil company on Wednesday announced that production would remain stable until 2030, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year. Shell will invest $40bn in oil and gas production between 2023 and 2035, compared with between $10bn and $15bn in “low-carbon” products.
