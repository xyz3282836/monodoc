`Snicker` if you wish. `Guffaw` for good measure. Bill May and other male synchronized swimmers have heard the `putdowns` before. But they’re getting the last laugh. Men have competed in `synchro` at the lower levels for decades. Now they’re being included in the Olympics, meaning next year’s Summer Games in Paris. “I think it’s a huge opportunity for the sport to grow and attract more men,” May told the Associated Press at the World `Aquatics` Championships. “By keeping men out you’re limiting the sport. By including men you’re going to see an `upshift` in the popularity and the numbers.”
