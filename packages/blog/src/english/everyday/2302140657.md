Romance is in the air as we approach Valentine's Day on February 14. A day to honour love, it is observed by giving gifts and making romantic gestures to our loved ones. The day is traditionally associated with love, romance, and the exchange of gifts between couples. While this is the most common perception of Valentine’s Day, it is not meant exclusively for couples. In fact, it can be celebrated by anyone who wants to express their affection for someone special, regardless of their relationship status. Valentine's Day is a day for celebrating love, not just romantic love between couples. It's a day to celebrate the love we have for our friends, family members, and even ourselves.
