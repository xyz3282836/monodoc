When OpenAI introduced its artificial intelligence chatbot, GPT3, on November 30, 2022, the value of Microsoft, one of the main investors in this artificial intelligence (AI) company, jumped by $115 billion (€108 billion), or around 6.5%. In fact, Wall Street has `grasped` that a revolution is taking place. AI is having an "iPhone moment" and will shake up society the way Apple did in 2007. For months, Wall Street has not `wanted anything to do with` Big Tech: Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, etc. They're all past their `heyday`. The `turnaround` means that AI engines will need billions of dollars in `investments`, and it is the tech giants that will have the means to develop them.
