The world population is ageing and most countries in the world are experiencing an increase in both the number and `proportion` of older people in their population. As we live longer thanks to technology, in the near future there will be a need for senior citizens to talk to. The walker/talker job will be just that — talking to elderly in need of companionship, listening to them talk and taking the more mobile of them for a walk. This will be great for people that like to listen and interact with their `fellow` human beings.
