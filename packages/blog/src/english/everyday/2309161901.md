Residents in a Portuguese village woke up to an almost `biblical` scene on Sunday morning. The streets were `impassable`, replaced by a `raging` river of close to 600,000 gallons of red wine. After two wine tanks belonging to a local `distillery` `burst`, enough `booze` flowed down the roads of São Lourenço do Bairro to fill an Olympic-size pool — and to `spark` fears from local leaders about possible environmental damage. Though wine flooded the streets of the town of some 2,200 people for most of the day, firefighters were able to `divert` the liquid before it `gushed` into the nearby Cértima River.
