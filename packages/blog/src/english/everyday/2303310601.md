Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives are calling for a six-month pause in training systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched model GPT-4, they said in an open letter, citing potential risks to society and humanity. The letter, issued by the non-profit Future of Life Institute and signed by more than 1,000 people including Musk, called for a pause on advanced AI development until shared safety protocols for such designs were developed, implemented and audited by independent experts.

埃隆·马斯克和一群人工智能专家和行业高管在一封公开信中说，他们呼吁对比OpenAI新推出的模型GPT-4更强大的系统暂停训练六个月，理由是其对社会和人类有潜在风险。 这封信由非营利组织生命未来研究所（Future of Life Institute）发布，包括马斯克在内的1000多人签署，呼吁暂停先进的人工智能开发，直到此类设计的共享安全协议被制定、实施并由独立专家审查。
