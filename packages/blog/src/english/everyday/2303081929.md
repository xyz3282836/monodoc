The gender pay gap has widened significantly as the `spiralling` cost of childcare `puts off` mothers from returning to work. On average, men earned 14.4 per cent more than women in Britain in 2021, according to the latest Women in Work report from PwC, the Big Four `accountancy` firm. In the previous year, the pay gap was 12 per cent. The increase of 2.4 percentage points was four times the average increase seen across other developed nations during the year. The “most significant driver” of the wider pay gap was the rising cost of childcare, PwC said.
