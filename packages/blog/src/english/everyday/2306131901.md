The climate crisis is leading to more `turbulence` during flights, driving up costs and increasing the risks for passengers and crew, according to new research.The study found that warmer air, caused by `carbon` `emissions`, is creating `bumpier` flights around the world with `severe` turbulence in the North Atlantic up by 55% since 1979. The study’s co-author Mark Prosser, from the University of Reading, said every additional minute spent travelling through turbulence increased the wear and `tear` on an aircraft, as well as the risk of injuries to passengers and flight attendants.
