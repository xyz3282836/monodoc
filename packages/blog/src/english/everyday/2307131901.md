Milan Kundera, one of the biggest names in European literature in recent decades, has died in Paris aged 94. His best-known work was his 1984 novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Anna Mrazova, a spokeswoman for the Milan Kundera Library in his home city of Brno in the Czech Republic, said he had died after a long illness. A `poetic` and `satirical` author, Kundera's novels won `praise` for their observation of both politics and everyday life. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his work reached "whole generations of readers across all `continents` and achieved global fame". "He leaves behind not only `notable` `fiction`, but also significant `essay` work."
