China’s Alibaba Group said on Tuesday that it would become a `holding company` with six different business groups. Alibaba described the restructuring as the “most significant” organizational `overhaul` in its 24-year history. It said each unit would have its own chief executive and `board` of directors to allow for quicker decision-making. The units will be allowed to seek outside `capital` with an eye toward `eventual` initial public offerings. Only its China e-commerce unit, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, will remain a `wholly` owned Alibaba entity.
