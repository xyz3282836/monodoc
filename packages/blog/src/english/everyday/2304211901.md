A crowd `crush` at an event to distribute financial aid in Yemen’s capital killed at least 85 people while dozens more suffered `injuries`, a Houthi official has said. The crush took place on Wednesday in the Old City in the centre of Sana’a when hundreds of people gathered at the event organised by `merchants`, according to the Houthi-run `interior` ministry. The ministry’s `spokesperson` `blamed` the disaster on the “random distribution” of funds without `coordination` with local authorities. At least “85 were killed and more than 322 were injured”, a Houthi security official told the AFP news agency.
