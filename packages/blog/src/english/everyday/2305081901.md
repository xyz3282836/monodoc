Loneliness presents a `profound` public health threat `akin` to smoking and obesity, U.S. `Surgeon` General Vivek H. Murthy warned in an `advisory` `issued` Tuesday that aims to `rally` Americans to spend more time with each other in an increasingly divided and digital society. Murthy said half of U.S. adults experience loneliness, which has consequences for `mental and physical` health, including a greater risk of `depression`, `anxiety` — and, perhaps more surprisingly, heart disease, `stroke` and `dementia`.
