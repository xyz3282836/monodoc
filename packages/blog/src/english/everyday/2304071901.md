Is it rude to `knit` at work? Recently, a county `councilor` in Wales was `accused` by a `colleague` on Twitter of `bringing` the body “into `disrepute`” for knitting during a virtual public meeting. The `criticism` has touched off a `debate` about whether it is `appropriate` to pull out knitting needles in video `huddles`. Knitters say it isn’t the same as `sneaking` a phone under the camera or scrolling the internet. Knitting, they say, sharpens their attention, allowing them to focus more than they would with idle hands.
