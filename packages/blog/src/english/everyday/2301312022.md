Last Tuesday was a rough day for Goldman Sachs. The share price fell 6 percent after `the Wall Street` `giant` reported its worst earnings miss in a decade. On a call that morning, analysts `peppered` David Solomon, the bank’s C.E.O., with questions about its consumer banking strategy. Goldman closed its $2.2 billion `acquisition` of GreenSky, a `pioneer` in the “buy now, pay later” lending `sector`. It `flew` under the `radar` until last quarter, the first in which Goldman broke out earnings for its “platform solutions” business unit, which includes GreenSky. The picture wasn’t pretty. `Revenues` were up, but the division lost $1.66 billion in 2022.
