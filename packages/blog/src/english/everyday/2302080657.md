Apple on Thursday posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season. The company’s sales of $117 billion for the October-December period represented a 5% decline from the same time in the previous year, a deeper downturn than analysts had projected. It marks Apple’s first year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue since the January-March period in 2019 when sales also slipped 5% amid slowing iPhone demand. Apple’s profit also eroded during the past quarter, even though the California company remained a pillar of prosperity.

苹果公司周四公布了近四年来的首次季度收入下降，因为新冠疫情导致的对其工厂的限制，减少了假期期间最新 iPhone 的销售。该公司 10 月至 12 月期间的销售额为 1,170 亿美元，比上年同期下降了 5%，比分析师预测的下滑幅度更大。 这标志着苹果公司自 2019 年 1-3 月以来季度收入首次同比下降，当时由于对 iPhone 的需求放缓，销售额也下滑了 5%。在过去的一个季度里，苹果的利润也受到侵蚀，尽管这家位于加州的公司仍然是繁荣的支柱。
