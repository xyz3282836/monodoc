Nicole Kidman has `revealed` she had to lie about her height early in her career, taking half an inch off to secure `auditions`. Kidman is 5ft 11in (1.8 metres) but she told the Radio Times she would `pretend` to be 5ft 10 and a half to get work. “I was told, ‘You won’t have a career. You’re too tall’,” she said. “People would say, ‘How’s the air up there?’ Now, I get, ‘You’re so much taller than I thought’, or men grappling with how high my heels should be.”
