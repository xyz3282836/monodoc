Apple Inc. is returning to a `frequent trick` it uses to keep buyers interested in its current iPhone line until the new model arrives: adding a new color. The company announced a yellow version of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus on Tuesday, adding to the existing midnight blue, purple, red and `starlight` options. The new model — which doesn’t add any additional enhancements — becomes available for preorder on March 10 and will go on sale in retail stores on March 14, the company said.
