Global `plastic` `pollution` could be `slashed` by 80% by 2040, according to a report from the UN Environment Programme. The changes needed are major, but are also practical and `affordable`, the agency said. The first step is to `eliminate` unnecessary plastics, such as `excessive` packaging, the report said. Then next steps are to increase the reuse of plastics, such as `refillable` `bottles`, boosting recycling and replace plastics with greener `alternatives`.
