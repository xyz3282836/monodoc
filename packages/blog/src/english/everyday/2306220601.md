The Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Festival) is a traditional holiday that `commemorates` the life and death of the famous Chinese `scholar` Qu Yuan (340-278 B.C.). The festival falls on the 5th day of the fifth month on lunar Chinese calendar. Among the famous `paintings` from ancient China, there are many others `themed` the Dragon Boat Festival. Since ancient times, many artists, including Zhang Daqian and Qi Baishi, have been inspired by the Festival to express their feelings.
