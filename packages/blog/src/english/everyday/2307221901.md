There are `fears` a type of `feline` `coronavirus` may kill cat populations across the world if it continues to spread. Feline `infectious` `peritonitis` (FIP), which is not transmissible to humans, is estimated to have killed thousands of cats on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in recent months. So far just 107 cases of FIP have been officially recorded by the `agriculture` ministry in the southern part of the island, but experts think the true number is much higher `owing` to the country’s huge `stray` cat population. Head of Cat Protection and Welfare Society (PAWS) Cyprus, and `vice-president` of Cyprus Voice for Animals, Dinos Ayiomamitis, said: ‘We have lost 300,000 cats since January from FIP.’ Cyprus is known by some as the "island of cats" because it features the earliest known evidence of the `domestication` of the animal 9,500 years ago.
