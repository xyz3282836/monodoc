Poor sleep may `undermine` attempts to maintain weight loss, research has suggested. Millions of people who are overweight or `obese` manage to lose weight every year. But many often then face a `struggle` to keep the pounds `creeping` back. Now results from a `randomised` `trial`, which was conducted by the University of Copenhagen and presented at the European `Congress` on `Obesity`, suggests better and longer sleep patterns could help keep the weight off for good.
