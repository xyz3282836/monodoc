Portland, Oregon received nearly a foot of snow in a single day in what proved to be its second-snowiest day in history. Mountainous areas of California experienced nearly `unprecedented` snowfall `accumulations` - more than 40 feet since the start of the season. At the airport in Flagstaff, Arizona, 11.6 feet have fallen this season, second only to the winter of 1948-49. Even Phoenix `suburbs` woke up on Thursday to a `dusting` of snow that covered `cactuses` and `lush` golf courses.
