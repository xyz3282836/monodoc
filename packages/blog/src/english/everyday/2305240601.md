Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and its partners will develop a moon lander for NASA, a victory for the space company after it missed out on a similar contract two years ago. Officials from `the National Aeronautics and Space Administration` said Friday that it would use a lander created by Blue Origin’s team for its `Artemis` exploration program. The vehicle would transport astronauts from an orbiting craft to the surface of the moon on a future mission.
