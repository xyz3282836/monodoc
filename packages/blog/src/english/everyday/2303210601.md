Banking giant UBS is buying troubled `rival` Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal `orchestrated` by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking `turmoil` in the global banking system. `Swiss authorities` pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to `reassure` investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks `plunged` this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other `potentially` `shaky` `institutions` in the global financial system.
