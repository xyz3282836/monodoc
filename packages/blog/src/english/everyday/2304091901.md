After gaining 30 pounds during the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Daniel Murillo is finally getting back into fighting shape. Early pandemic `lockdowns`, endless hours on his laptop and heightened stress led Murillo, 27, to reach for cookies and chips in the `barracks` at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Gyms were closed, organized `exercise` was out and Murillo’s motivation to work out on his own was low. “I could notice it,” said Murillo, who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighed as much as 192 pounds. “The `uniform` was tighter.”
