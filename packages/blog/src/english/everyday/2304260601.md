Japanese animated sports film The First Slam Dunk, a "`nostalgia` trigger" as `netizens` put it, has earned big at the Chinese mainland `box office`, bringing in more than 390 million yuan in its first five days, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. Released on April 20, the film, based on Japanese artist Takehiko Inoue's best-selling `manga` series in the 1990s, has now `swept up` Chinese `moviegoers`. It has set a record for the largest screen share for an animated feature in a "single day" and a "premier day" in the Chinese mainland `cinema` history.
