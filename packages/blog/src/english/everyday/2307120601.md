Schools in New Delhi were forced to close Monday after heavy `monsoon` rains `battered` the Indian capital, with `landslides` and flash floods killing at least 15 people over the last three days. Farther north, the overflowing Beas River swept vehicles downstream as it flooded neighborhoods. In Japan, `torrential` rain `pounded` the southwest, causing floods and `mudslides` that left two people dead and at least six others missing Monday. Local TV showed damaged houses in Fukuoka `prefecture` and `muddy` water from the `swollen` Yamakuni River appearing to threaten a bridge in the town of Yabakei. In Ulster County, in New York’s Hudson Valley and in Vermont, some said the flooding is the worst they’ve seen since Hurricane Irene’s `devastation` in 2011.
