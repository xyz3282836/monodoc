Humans are able to detect artificially generated speech only 73% of the time, a study has found, with the same levels of `accuracy` found in English and `Mandarin` speakers. Researchers at University College London used a text-to-speech algorithm trained on two publicly available datasets, one in English and the other in Mandarin, to generate 50 deepfake speech samples in each language. The sound samples were played for 529 participants to see whether they could detect the real sample from fake speech. The participants were able to identify fake speech only 73% of the time.
