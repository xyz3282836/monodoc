Cat owners in England are facing a "weird" and "unsettling" problem: Someone, somewhere, is targeting their pets and randomly `shaving` off parts of their `fur`. At least 80 pets have reportedly had chunks of their fur sliced out since last year, according to an animal `charity` that is mapping out the attacks to help warn concerned owners. The strange incidents have received national coverage, with British media `dubbing` the unknown `perpetrator` the "phantom cat shaver".
