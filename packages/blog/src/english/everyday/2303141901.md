It was called Silicon Valley Bank, but its `collapse` is causing shockwaves around the world. From `winemakers` in California to `startups` across the Atlantic Ocean, companies are `scrambling` to `figure out` how to manage their finances after their bank suddenly shut down Friday. The `meltdown` means `distress` not only for businesses but also for all their workers whose `paychecks` may get tied up in the `chaos`. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday that he’s talking with the White House to help “stabilize the situation as quickly as possible, to protect jobs, people’s `livelihoods`, and the `entire` `innovation` ecosystem that has served as a tent `pole` for our economy.”
