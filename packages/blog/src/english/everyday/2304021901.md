Many of us worry that we don’t get enough `exercise`. But the `mere` belief that we aren’t moving enough can have `negative` consequences for our health, according to `emerging` science about how our mind-set affects our bodies. A `fascinating` new study of mind-sets and exercise, though, shows that learning how much we actually move by tracking our steps could help us start thinking of ourselves as active people, which can pay health `dividends`, even if we don’t start exercising more.
