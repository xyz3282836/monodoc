Japan is to begin releasing wastewater from the `wrecked` Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant from Thursday, in `defiance` of opposition from fishing communities, China and some scientists. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said that `disposing` of more than 1m tonnes of water being stored at the site is an essential part of the long and complex process to `decommission` the plant. But the plan, announced by Kishida on Tuesday, has caused `controversy` because the water contains `tritium`, a radioactive substance that can’t be removed by the `facility’s` water filtration technology.
