Workers in the U.S. are spending more time in the office again, with occupancy rates surpassing 50% for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Average office use last week was 50.4% of early 2020 levels in 10 major U.S. cities, according to Kastle Systems, which tracks security swipes into buildings every business day. It is the first time office occupancy has topped 50%, according to Kastle, since March 2020, when Covid-19 forced most workplaces to temporarily shut down. All 10 of the major cities it tracks surpassed 40% for the first time, Kastle said.

美国员工又一次延长了在办公室的时间，如今办公室的使用率在疫情爆发后首次超过了 50%。 在美国十大主要城市，上周办公室平均使用率达到 2020 年早期的 50.4%，Kastel Systems 通过追踪每个工作日进入办公楼的安全磁卡刷卡记录得出这一结论。Kastel 称，这是 2020 年 3 月以来，疫情让大部分办公场所临时关闭后，办公室使用率首次超过 50%，这也是首次全部 10 个主要城市返岗率均超过 40%。
