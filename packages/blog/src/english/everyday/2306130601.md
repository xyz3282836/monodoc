Since his emergence at the top level of professional tennis 18 years ago, Novak Djokovic has used the `dizzying` bar set by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal before him as inspiration to push himself to his limits, never `doubting` that he would one day rise above it. What once seemed impossible eventually became `inevitable`. On Sunday, Djokovic finally `surpassed` his great `rivals` in the most significant category of all as he defeated Casper Ruud 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 to `clinch` his 23rd grand slam title, breaking his `tie` of 22 with Nadal.
