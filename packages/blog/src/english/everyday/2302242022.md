Unilever PLC wants to warm up its ice cream freezers in convenience stores without turning its products into puddles, part of a broader effort to pursue green goals and potentially boost sales in the process. The consumer packaged goods giant, which sells ice cream brands including Ben & Jerry’s and Magnum, is testing the performance of its products in freezers that are set to temperatures of roughly 10 degrees Fahrenheit, up from the industry standard of zero.

联合利华（Unilever PLC）希望将便利店的冰淇淋冰柜升温，但不使其产品融化成水，这是其追求绿色目标大背景下的一部分努力，联合利华也希望在此过程中促进销售。 这家销售 Ben & Jerry's 和梦龙等冰淇淋的消费品巨头，正在测试其产品在温度设置在约 10 华氏度（-12 摄氏度）的冰柜中的表现，而冰淇淋的行业标准是设置在零华氏度（-17.8 摄氏度）。
