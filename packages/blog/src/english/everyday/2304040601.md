`Punishing` storms swept through a large `swath` of the nation Friday night into Saturday, `unleashing` deadly `tornadoes` and `carving` a path of `destruction` that killed at least 20 people in the South and Midwest while knocking out power for more than 700,000 customers. The storms were most `lethal` in Tennessee, a state still `reeling` from Monday’s horrific school shooting in Nashville that took the lives of a half dozen students and adults.
