Health regulators are being `urged` to `rapidly` approve two gamechanging `dementia` `drugs` in order to ensure millions of people who could benefit are not left in `limbo`, after more stunning trial data. The final results from a `landmark` study confirmed that donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, slowed `cognitive` decline in Alzheimer’s patients by 35%. Trial results published last year showed that a second drug, lecanemab, made by Eisai and Biogen, reduced the rate by 27%. Health leaders `hailed` the arrival of the drugs as a turning point in the fight against Alzheimer’s, through which the disease could become just as manageable as conditions such as `diabetes` or `asthma`.
