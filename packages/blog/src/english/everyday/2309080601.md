A short video series is `racking` up views in China, `amplifying` calls for the British Museum to return artefacts. It tells the story of a `jade` `teapot`, played by a woman, looking for its way back to China. The world-`renowned` museum has been under pressure after 2,000 items were reported to be "missing, stolen or damaged" last month. The `scandal` has prompted demands from China and other countries for treasures to be returned. Titled Escape from the British Museum, the three-part series from two Chinese social media influencers tells the story of a jade teapot coming alive and taking a human form as she tries to escape from the museum.
