Say goodbye to refilling that Coke. McDonald’s is `getting rid of` self-served soda. The Chicago-based fast food chain plans to `eliminate` self-service soda machines at its U.S. restaurants by 2032, McDonald’s confirmed this week. It’s unclear if locations outside the U.S. will follow suit. In an email to The Associated Press Tuesday, McDonald’s USA said the goal of the change is to create consistency for customers and crew members across the chain’s offerings — from in-person `dining` to online delivery and drive-`thru` options.
