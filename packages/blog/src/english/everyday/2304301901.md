What can older adults who have lost their closest friends and family members do as they `contemplate` the future without them? If, as research has found, good relationships are essential to health and well-being in later life, what happens when connections `forged` over the years end? It would be foolish to suggest these relationships can be easily replaced: They cannot. There’s no `substitute` for people who’ve known you a long time, who understand you deeply. Still, opportunities to create `bonds` with other people exist. “It’s never too late to develop meaningful relationships,” said Robert Waldinger, a `clinical` professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
