Sending a child to a state secondary school costs families at least £39 each week, and £19 a week for children at primary school, according to research based on a child’s minimum needs. The study by the Child `Poverty` Action Group (CPAG) found that the associated costs of transport, lunch, uniform, `school trips` and learning materials combined amounts to hundreds of pounds a year for each child at a UK state school.
