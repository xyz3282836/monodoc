Global `carbon` `dioxide` `emissions` are still rising but may at least be reaching a `plateau`, research from the International Energy Agency has shown. CO2 from energy – by far the biggest source of emissions – increased by less than 1% in 2022. This was `despite` the `turmoil` in energy the markets caused by Russia’s `invasion` of Ukraine. The rise is smaller than the 6% increase in emissions from energy recorded by the IEA in 2021, a `leap` that came on the back of the `rebound` from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a 7% reduction is needed every year to meet the goal of `halving` emissions this decade.
