It has long been `touted` that 10,000 steps a day is the magic number you need to stay fit and healthy - but a new study shows fewer than 5,000 may be enough to see a benefit. The analysis of more than 226,000 people around the world showed 4,000 was enough to start reducing the risk of dying `prematurely` of any cause. Just over 2,300 is enough to benefit the heart and blood `vessels`. The more you do, the more health benefits are seen, researchers said. Every extra 1,000 steps beyond the 4,000 reduced the risk of dying early by 15% up to 20,000 steps.
