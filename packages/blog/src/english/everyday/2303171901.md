Lawmakers in Nevada are considering new rules that would give water managers the authority to cap how much water residents could use in their homes, a step that reflects the `dire` conditions on the Colorado River after more than two decades of drought. Among the Western states that `rely on` the Colorado River for `sustenance`, Nevada has long been a leader in water `conservation`, establishing laws that limit the size of swimming pools and ban `decorative` `grass`. Residents now consume less water than they did 20 years ago.
