A movie `theater` in Alaska had an unusual visitor on April 19, with a `curious` moose `sauntering` in to take a look around. Security footage from the theater in Kenai, Alaska, as well as videos taken by a worker behind the theater counter, show the moose entering the `lobby`, `munching` on some `popcorn` and leftover food from the trash, and then `promptly` leaving again. "Moosey came into my work at the Kenai Cinemas. Sorry `buddy` you can't bring your own snacks into the movies," theater worker Jasmynne Palmer `captioned` a video of the moose on Facebook.
