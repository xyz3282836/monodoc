In a world first, scientists say that an 8cm worm has been found alive in the brain of an Australian woman. The "string-like structure" was pulled from the patient's damaged `frontal` `lobe` `tissue` during `surgery` in Canberra last year. The red `parasite` could have been there for up to two months. "Everyone in that operating `theatre` got the shock of their life when [the `surgeon`] took some `forceps` to pick up an `abnormality` and the abnormality turned out to be a `wriggling`, live 8cm light red worm," said Sanjaya Senanayake, an `infectious` diseases doctor at Canberra Hospital.
