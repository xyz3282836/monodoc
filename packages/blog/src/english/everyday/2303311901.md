A `rigorous` new study that examined the health effects of coffee `consumption` found good news and bad news for coffee lovers. The research showed that coffee has `striking` effects on physical activity levels, causing people to move more, taking, on average, 1,000 extra steps a day — a significant boost in activity that might help explain why coffee consumption has long been linked to better health. But the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, did find some downsides to a daily `cuppa`. It showed that people lost about 36 minutes of nightly sleep on days when they drank coffee — and the more coffee they drank, the less they slept.
