A woman in Mexico `shielded` her son after a bear `leaped` on to a `picnic` table, inches from his face, and `devoured` the `tacos` and enchiladas meant for his birthday dinner. Silvia Macías of Mexico City had travelled to the Chipinque Park on the `outskirts` of the northern city of Monterrey to celebrate the 15th birthday of her son, Santiago, who has Down’s `syndrome`. Soon after they sat down to eat, the bear showed up and `gulped` down `french` `fries`, `enchiladas`, tacos and `salsa`. A video shot by her friend Angela Chapa shows Macías sitting `stoically`, inches from the bear’s mouth, holding Santiago and shielding his eyes with her hand. Macías kept her eyes `downcast` to avoid anything the bear might consider a challenge.
