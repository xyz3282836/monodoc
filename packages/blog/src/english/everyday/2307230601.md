With the dog days of the year coming along with the summer holidays, Chinese travelers are `unleashing` their long `pent`-up energy on trips overseas. Some unexpected names have become new favorites on their list of destinations in addition to the traditional destinations in Europe and the US, including some countries in the Middle East and Africa. Data from online travel platform Tuniu shows that since June, there has been a huge demand for visas for destinations including Singapore, Thailand, France, Malaysia, New Zealand, Italy, Spain, Vietnam, Greece and Russia, which are among the most popular overseas destinations in the summer. Ranked in the top 10 destinations, there are only four European countries, and no US.
