As Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan arrived in Seoul on Sunday to `nurture` a `fledgling` `détente` between the neighboring countries, South Koreans were waiting `intently` for what he had to say about Japan’s `brutal` `colonial` rule of the Korean Peninsula in the early 20th century. Mr. Kishida’s two-day trip follows a visit in March by South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, to Tokyo. It means that `shuttle` `diplomacy` between two key U.S. `allies` is back on track after regular exchanges between the countries’ leaders ended `abruptly` in 2011 over historical differences.
