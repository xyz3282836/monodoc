`Nestled` in the mountains of eastern China’s Zhejiang province, a Taoism college `dubbed` “China’s Hogwarts” is drawing waves of young Chinese `eager` to learn traditional arts, from `fortunetelling` to `spiritual` `enlightenment`. But unlike the `fictional` school of `witchcraft` and `wizardry`, they come not for spells and `sorcery`, but for its classes in the I Ching, `martial` arts, and `rituals` aimed at bridging the gap between `mortality` and the cosmos. Though the Zhejiang Taoist Academy has been around since 2013, this year marks a significant shift: The college received a record-breaking 1,300 applicants, nearly a thousand more than the previous year.
