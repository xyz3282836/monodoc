Another important figure of Chinese soccer has been brought down, according to a statement from the Hubei Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection on Tuesday night, as the anti-corruption storm of Chinese soccer keeps deepening. This time it was Chen Xuyuan, president of Chinese Football Association (CFA), who was put under investigation on suspicion of serious violations of law and discipline. On the same day, China Fortune Land Development Co said that its co-president Meng Jing had been detained. Meng is a former board member of the Hebei Football Club.

根据湖北省纪委周二晚间的声明，随着中国足球反腐风暴的不断深入，中国足球的又一位重要人物落马。 这一次是中国足协主席陈戌源因涉嫌严重违法违纪而被调查。同一天，华夏幸福置业有限公司表示，其联合总裁孟惊已被拘留。孟惊是河北（华夏幸福）足球俱乐部的前董事会成员。
