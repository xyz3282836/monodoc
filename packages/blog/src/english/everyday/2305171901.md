A series of `minor` `tremors` recorded on the Danish Baltic island of Bornholm has `puzzled` scientists, who now say they were caused by “`acoustic` pressure waves from an unknown source”. At first the tremors on Saturday were thought to have been caused by earthquakes. Then, `seismologists` `theorised` they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than 90 miles (140km) to the south.
