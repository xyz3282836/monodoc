Now should be South America’s `bleak` midwinter, but several parts of the `continent` are experiencing an extraordinary unseasonal heatwave that scientists believe offers a `disturbing` `glimpse` of a future of extreme weather. Argentina’s riverside capital, Buenos Aires, this week recorded its hottest 1 August in 117 years. Cindy Fernández, a weather `bureau` spokesperson, said her country was facing “a year of extreme heat”. “Winter temperatures are way off the scale – not only in the central region where Buenos Aires is but also in the northern regions `bordering` Bolivia and Paraguay where temperatures reached between 37°C (98.6℉) and 39°C (102.2℉) this week.”
