You know instantly when someone is speaking to an `infant` or small child. It turns out that dolphin mothers also use a kind of high-`pitched` baby talk. A study published Monday found that female `bottlenose` dolphins change their tone when addressing their `calves`. Researchers recorded the signature `whistles` of 19 mother dolphins in Florida, when `accompanied` by their young `offspring` and when swimming alone or with other adults.
