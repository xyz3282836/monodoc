OpenAI’s ChatGPT made its `debut` in Japanese `parliamentary` `deliberations`, with the `premier` fielding questions from an opposition `lawmaker` that were drawn up with the help of the chatbot. Kazuma Nakatani, of the `Constitutional Democratic Party`, said in a session of parliament Wednesday that he asked ChatGPT: “What kind of questions would you ask the prime minister if you were a member of the lower house of parliament?” He then used those responses to form questions for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during a discussion around a draft `amendment` related to Covid-19 `pandemic` policy.
