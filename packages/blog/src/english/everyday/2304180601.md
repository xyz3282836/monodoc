Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was `evacuated` unharmed Saturday after someone threw an `explosive` device in his direction while he was campaigning at a fishing port in western Japan, officials said. Police `wrestled` a suspect to the ground as `screaming` `bystanders` `scrambled` to get away and smoke filled the air. Although no one was hurt, and Kishida continued campaigning Saturday, the `chaotic` scene was `reminiscent` of the `assassination` nine months ago of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
