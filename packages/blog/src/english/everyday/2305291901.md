China will fully `resume` the quick customs `clearance` at ports starting from Monday in a `bid` to `facilitate` the exchange of Chinese and foreign travelers and `promote` the opening-up to the world. Optimization measures released by the National Immigration Administration (NIA) on Thursday `indicate` that the country's international travels that were hindered due to COVID-19 will be restored to pre-epidemic levels.
