Two more than 1,000-year-old cultural `relics` were returned to China after a ceremony at the Manhattan District ­`Attorney`'s Office in New York on Tuesday. Chinese `Consul` `General` in New York Huang Ping attended the ceremony, where officials from both sides agreed that the return will "bring positive energy into China-US relations." The two countries will continue to `proactively` cooperate in the tracing, recovery and return of stolen cultural relics, according to a statement from China's `Consulate` General in New York on Wednesday.
