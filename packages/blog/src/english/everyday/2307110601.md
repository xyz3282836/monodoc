Robots have no plans to steal the jobs of humans or `rebel` against their creators, but would like to make the world their playground, nine of the most advanced `humanoid` robots have told an artificial intelligence `summit` in Geneva. In what was described as “the world’s first human-robot `press` `conference`”, one robot, Sophia, said humanoid robots had the potential to lead with “a greater level of efficiency and effectiveness than human leaders” but that “effective `synergy`” came when humans and AI worked together. “AI can provide `unbiased` data while humans can provide the emotional intelligence and creativity to make the best decisions. Together, we can achieve great things,” it said.
