The company behind the famous `denim` brand Levi's, Levi Strauss & Co., announced a `partnership` with Lalaland.ai on 22nd March. This partnership will lead the company's technology to create AI-generated models to showcase Levi Strauss & Co.’s clothing line. Lalaland.ai is a digital fashion `studio` that builds customised AI-generated models. Lalaland.ai uses advanced artificial intelligence to enable fashion brands and `retailers` to create `hyper-realistic` models of every body type, age, size and skin tone. The company believes that with these `body-inclusive` `avatars`, the company aims to create a more inclusive, personal and sustainable shopping experience for fashion brands, retailers and customers.
