Donald Trump has been `indicted` by a Manhattan `grand jury`, `prosecutors` and `defense lawyers` said Thursday, making him the first former U.S. president to face a `criminal` `charge` and `jolting` his `bid` to `retake` the White House next year. The charges remained under `seal` late Thursday, but the `investigation` centered on payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to `silence` `claims` of an `extramarital` `sexual encounter`.
