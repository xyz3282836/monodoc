Thinking about spring cleaning? The best place to start isn’t the `kitchen`, `garage` or `closets`. This year, try starting with your mind. By April, most people have all but forgotten the New Year’s `resolutions` they made four months ago, and many have fallen back into old habits that get in the way of better health and happiness. But spring is a great time to reset, `declutter` and `recalibrate` your mind and goals. Research suggests that spring may be one of the best times to start a new habit or make a change.
