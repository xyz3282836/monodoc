Burning Man attenders began their slow `exodus` from the `campsite` in the northern Nevada `desert` after `muddy` roads that left tens of thousands of `partygoers` `stranded` for days dried up enough to make travel possible. Festival organisers said they started to let traffic flow out of the main road around 2pm local time on Monday – even as they continued to ask revelers to delay their exit to Tuesday to ease traffic. As of Monday afternoon, they said about 64,000 people remained at the festival site.
