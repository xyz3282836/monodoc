New York City officials said Tuesday that the city will require all of its elementary schools to employ `phonics` programs in teaching children to read, saying alternate systems that have been in place for years are failing. The announcement from the nation’s largest school system is fresh `evidence` of a national shift underway toward what supporters call “the science of reading,” in which children are `explicitly` taught how to sound out words.
