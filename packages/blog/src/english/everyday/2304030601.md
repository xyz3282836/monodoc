Turkey’s `parliament` has voted to approve Finland’s NATO membership bid, `paving` the way for the `Nordic` country to join the security `alliance`. The decision only applies to Finland, not Sweden, its neighbor and `fellow` NATO hopeful. Both countries applied on the same day last year. Thursday’s vote was the last `hurdle` in Finland’s quest to join the `military` organization.
