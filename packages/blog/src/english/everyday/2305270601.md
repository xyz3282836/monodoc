After her husband died last year, she wrote a children’s book on `grief`. Now she’s charged with his murder. Kouri Richins was `arrested` on Monday in Utah and is `accused` in charging documents of `poisoning` her husband with a `lethal` `dose` of `fentanyl` at their home in Kamas, a small mountain town near Park City. `Prosecutors` `allege` that Richins called authorities in the middle of the night in March 2022 to report that her husband, Eric Richins, was “cold to the touch.”
