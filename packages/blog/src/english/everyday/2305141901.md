More than 100 types of common consumer products contain at least one, and often multiple, chemicals linked to cancer or `reproductive` and `developmental` problems, according to research published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Many of the chemicals were found in personal care products, including `nail` `polish`, shampoo, `lotion` and `soap`. Cleaning products, particularly all-purpose cleaners, `laundry` `detergent` and `dish` soap, also contained numerous chemicals.
