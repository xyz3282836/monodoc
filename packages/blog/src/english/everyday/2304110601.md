The red-hot `labor` market cooled some in March, with hiring gains `moderating` and `wage` growth `easing` as more workers `sought` jobs. Employers added 236,000 workers last month, a historically strong gain but the smallest in more than two years, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%. More Americans jumped into the labor market in March, helping take pressure off wage increases.
