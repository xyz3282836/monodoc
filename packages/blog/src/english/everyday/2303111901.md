Japan was forced to `blow up` and destroy its `flagship` space rocket minutes after it `blasted off` on Tuesday, after one of its engine `ignitions` failed to properly operate. The `embarrassing` and costly action occurred during the `debut` launch of the country’s new heavy-lift H3 rocket, which `took off` from the Tanegashima Space Center and `hurtled` toward the Pacific Ocean moments later. The same rocket had an aborted launch last month. The incident strikes another blow to Japan’s efforts to become a competitive global space power.
