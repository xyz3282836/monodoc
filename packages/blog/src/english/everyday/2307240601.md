Extreme weather events driven by climate change are increasingly threatening ancient cultural `relics` in China’s northwestern Gansu province. New research indicates that `cave` paintings and artifacts in Dunhuang and Zhangye, particularly those in the Mogao Caves, a UNESCO World `Heritage` site, are facing significant `deterioration` and damage due to `unprecedented` rainfall. In a study likely to be released later this week, researchers from the National Climate Center, Dunhuang Research Academy, and environmental nonprofit Greenpeace sought to assess the effects of climate change on the cave paintings. Combining `meteorological` data analysis, on-site observations, and in-depth assessments of the cave paintings and artifacts, they aimed to `shed` light on the deteriorating condition of these cultural relics, while `emphasizing` the need for conservation efforts and resource allocation.
