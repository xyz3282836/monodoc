Walt Disney Co. has laid off more than 300 employees in Beijing who worked on its streaming services, according to people familiar with the situation, part of a cost-cutting and `restructuring` effort at the entertainment company. The `layoffs` in China come as Disney this week started carrying out the first wave of cuts in a previously announced plan to slash 7,000 jobs. Disney said in a statement that the move in China “is part of the company’s cost-cutting effort and global reorganization.”
