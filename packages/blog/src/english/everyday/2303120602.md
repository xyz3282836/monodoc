The CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, will be `stepping down` after nine years at the `helm` of the world’s largest online video platform, she said in a blog post on Thursday. YouTube’s chief product officer, Neal Mohan, will be the new head of YouTube, she said. Wojcicki, 54, was previously a senior `vice-president` for ad products at Google and became CEO of YouTube in 2014. “Today, after nearly 25 years here, I’ve decided to step back from my role as the head of YouTube and start a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I’m `passionate` about,” said Wojcicki.
