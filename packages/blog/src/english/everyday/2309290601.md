Ozempic and similar drugs are `transforming` the world’s understanding of `obesity`. It isn’t so much about willpower: It’s about biology. The success of the powerful new class of `diabetes` and weight-loss drugs shows how important chemistry is to determining a person’s weight. The brain is the body’s chief chemist, regulating `appetite` and making it difficult for many people to `shed` pounds and keep them off. The brain determines how much fat it wants people to carry, according to years of research `bolstered` by the new drugs.
