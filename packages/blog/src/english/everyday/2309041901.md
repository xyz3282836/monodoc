Burger King must face a `lawsuit` that `alleges` it makes its Whopper burger appear larger on its menus than it is in reality, a US judge has ruled. The lawsuit `accuses` the fast food giant of misleading customers by showing the burger with a `meatier` `patty` and `ingredients` that "overflow over the bun". "The `plaintiffs`' claims are false," Burger King told the BBC. Rivals McDonald's and Wendy's are facing a similar lawsuit in the US.
