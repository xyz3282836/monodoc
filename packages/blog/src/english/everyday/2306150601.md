Donald Trump became the first former president to face a judge on `federal` charges as he `pleaded` not `guilty` in a Miami courtroom Tuesday to dozens of `felony` counts `accusing` him of `hoarding` classified documents and `refusing` government demands to give them back. The history-making court date, centered on charges that Trump mishandled government secrets that as commander-in-chief he was `entrusted` to protect, `kickstarts` a legal process that will `unfold` at the height of the 2024 presidential campaign and carry `profound` consequences not only for his political future but also for his own personal `liberty`.
