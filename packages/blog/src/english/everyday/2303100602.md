The Biden administration is preparing to relax COVID-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, according to two people familiar with the decision. The people, who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of `anonymity`, said the administration has decided to roll back the testing requirements as cases, hospitalizations and deaths are declining in China and the U.S. has `gathered` better information about the `surge`.
