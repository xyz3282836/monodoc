Get ready, this Friday — September 29 — will be the last supermoon of 2023. It's also this year's harvest moon, which is the full moon that occurs closest to the first day of autumn. A supermoon is a type of full moon that can appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the `faintest` moon of the year. That's because it's at its closest point to Earth, named the `perigee`, according to NASA. While this Friday's supermoon won't be the biggest of the year — that prize went to August's blue supermoon — it will still be larger than average and worth seeing.
