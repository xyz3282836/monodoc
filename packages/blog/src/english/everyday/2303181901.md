A `Mediterranean` `diet` of nuts, seafood, whole `grains` and vegetables could lower the risk of `dementia` by almost a quarter, according to promising early research that could `pave` the way for new `preventive` treatments. The data suggests eating lots of plant-based foods may have a “protective effect” against dementia, regardless of a person’s genetic risk, which the researchers said could form the basis for future public health strategies if further research confirms their findings.
