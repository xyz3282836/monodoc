Blackberries, cherries, apples and `apricots` might already be a part of your diet. If not, a new study might `convince` you to add them. The study, led by researchers at Columbia University and published in the scientific journal PNAS last month, found that foods high in `flavanols` ― like the ones mentioned above ― could make your mind sharper as you age. Flavanols are a type of `flavonoid`, a broader class of natural `substances` that are found in fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers, tea and wine, and are `hailed` for their `antioxidant` and biochemical properties.
