In the red corner, the world’s richest person, and in the blue corner, the world’s richest millennial: Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have agreed to a `cage` match, after Musk jokingly suggested the `bout` in response to efforts by Meta to launch a Twitter competitor. “I’m sure Earth can’t wait to be exclusively under Zuck’s thumb,” Musk tweeted on Wednesday in response to a post about Meta’s `rumoured` Threads app. The app, previously known inside Instagram as Project 92 and `Barcelona`, has been `pitched` to celebrities and influencers as a “stable place to build and grow” their `audiences`.
