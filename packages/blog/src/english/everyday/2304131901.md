Lake Tahoe has `attained` a `clarity` that scientists haven’t seen in 40 years – and it’s all because of a `microscopic` animal acting as a “natural clean-up crew” to restore the clear blue waters. On Monday, researchers from the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (TERC) released their annual report showing that the lake’s average visibility in 2022 was at 71.7ft – compared with 61ft in 2021 – which was largely due in part to a `spike` in clarity in the last five months of the year. The `dramatic` change can be attributed to an `uptick` in the `concentration` of `zooplankton`.
