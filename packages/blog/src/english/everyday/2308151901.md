Scientists have identified two types of `mole` that they believe have been living undiscovered in Turkey. DNA technology confirmed the `creatures` were biologically distinct from other moles. Both `inhabit` `mountainous` regions in eastern Turkey and can survive in temperatures of up to 50°C (122°F) in summer and under 2 metres (about 6ft) of snow in winter. Only one species, Talpa europaea, is found in Britain but further east there are a number of different moles, many of which have very small geographical ranges.
