Facebook parent Meta Platforms on Wednesday announced the launch of Threads, a stand-alone microblogging app that takes direct aim at Twitter as user `unrest` on that platform has grown since Elon Musk took the company over in October. Threads, which began allowing some posts earlier this week from people including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and `journalists` and `celebrities`, `rolled out` to users around the world Wednesday. The app will use some of Instagram’s infrastructure and allow people to use their Instagram login, a step that is likely to help it gain a following quickly, analysts have said.
