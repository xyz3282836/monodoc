Currently we leave `vast` amounts of data online and in the near future companies will need data detectives to go through it all and generate answers to business questions and make recommendations based on their findings. This will be done through `investigating` the data generated by the “Internet of Things end points, devices, sensors, `biometric` monitors, traditional computing `infrastructure`.” The position isn’t hard to imagine as many businesses already spend time and money going through people’s data so that they can sell them products.
