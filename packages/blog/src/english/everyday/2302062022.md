A first generation, unopened 2007 iPhone is expected to sell for more than $50,000 when it goes to auction on Thursday. The phone was given to Karen Green as a gift when she got a new job. But Green already had a new phone, and moreover, the iPhone was not compatible with her existing cellular network. Rather than open the iPhone, Green stuck it on a shelf. It remained there, “wrapped in a pair of felt pajamas”, for years. In October, Green heard that a first generation iPhone from 2007 had sold for $39,339.60. The cosmetic tattoo artist contacted LCG Auctions, the auction house that handled the sale and had found itself inundated by owners of old iPhones.

一台未拆封的 2007 年的初代 iPhone 在周四登上了拍卖会，并拍出了 5 万美金的预计售价。在 Karen Green 找到新工作的时候，有人送给她这台手机作为礼物。但 Green 已经有了一台新手机，而且这台 iPhone 与她现有的移动网络并不适配。Green 并没有拆封这台 iPhone，而是把它塞到了架子上。数年来，它一直在那里，“被一套毛毡睡衣包裹着”。十月，Green 听说 2007 年的初代 iPhone 可以被卖出 39,339.6 美元的高价。 这位纹绣师随后联系了促成这场交易的 LCG 拍卖行，这家交易行几乎被老款 iPhone 的拥有者淹没了。
