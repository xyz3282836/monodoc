Developing a consistent `workout` `routine` is going to take some `commitment`, according to new data. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a `peer`-reviewed `journal`, discovered the amount of time it may take to establish a gym habit is probably longer than you’d like ― around six months, according to the research. The study, which was led by researchers at Caltech, the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania, explored habit formation through machine learning tools that tracked the behaviors of thousands of people.
