A Chinese animated film, “Chang An,” featuring some of China’s most well-known poets has **won praise for** `drumming` up interest in traditional Chinese poetry and has been a surprise hit at the box office. Since its release on July 8, the film has fetched over 700 million yuan ($100 million) as of Monday, leading the `domestic` box office over the weekend. The film is set in the Tang dynasty, an especially `prosperous` era of Chinese history from 618 to 907, and `depicts` some of the era’s most famous poets including Li Bai, Du Fu, and Gao Shi — all `household` names in `contemporary` China, with the study of their poems `mandatory` at school.
