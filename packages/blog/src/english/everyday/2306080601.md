Another potentially beautiful day in the D.C. area has been somewhat `tainted` by wildfire smoke wafting across the skies. Tuesday was one of a growing number of days this spring, and now early summer, that smoke has `robbed` the DMV of bright sunshine and blue skies and at times lowered air quality and visibility. And the fire season is just getting started. While most days the smoke has remain higher in the atmosphere, some of Tuesday’s smoke — `brewed` by fires in Quebec — also made it to the surface. The same happened last Thursday from wildfires in New Jersey.
