Talk about a long `nap`. Scientists said they have revived worms `buried` in Siberian permafrost for 46,000 years. The half-dozen creatures, a type of `nematode` or `roundworm`, were last awake when Neanderthals and `woolly` `mammoths` `roamed` the Earth. They survived for millennia in `permafrost` by entering a state of suspended animation, according to a paper published Thursday in the journal PLOS Genetics. Genetic testing suggests the worms are a new and possibly extinct species, researchers said. “This paper could make people consider this third condition between life and death,” said Teymuras Kurzchalia, co-author of the study.
