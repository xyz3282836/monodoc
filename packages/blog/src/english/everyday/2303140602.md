The `metaphysical` multiverse `comedy` “Everything Everywhere All at Once” wrapped its hot dog fingers around Hollywood’s top prize Sunday, winning best picture at the 95th Academy Awards, along with awards for Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis. Though worlds away from Oscar bait[^ob], Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s `anarchic` ballet of everything `bagels`, googly-eyed rocks and one `messy` tax audit emerged as an `improbable` Academy Awards heavyweight. The `indie` hit, A24’s second best picture winner following “Moonlight,” won seven Oscars in all.

[^ob]: **Oscar bait** is a term used in the film community for movies that appear to have been produced for the sole purpose of earning nominations for [Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) or "Oscars", as they are commonly known.They are usually released just in advance of [Oscar season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_season), late in the calendar year, so as to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for the awards and be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters. The prestige or acclaim the studio may receive from the nomination or award is often secondary to the increased box office receipts such a film may garner; some films may even be depending on it to turn a profit.
