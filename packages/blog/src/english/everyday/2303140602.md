The `metaphysical` multiverse `comedy` “Everything Everywhere All at Once” wrapped its hot dog fingers around Hollywood’s top prize Sunday, winning best picture at the 95th Academy Awards, along with awards for Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis. Though worlds away from [^Oscar bait], Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s `anarchic` ballet of everything `bagels`, googly-eyed rocks and one `messy` tax audit emerged as an `improbable` Academy Awards heavyweight. The `indie` hit, A24’s second best picture winner following “Moonlight,” won seven Oscars in all.

[^Oscar bait]: **Oscar bait** is a term used in the film community for movies that appear to have been produced for the sole purpose of earning nominations for [Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) or "Oscars", as they are commonly known.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_bait#cite_note-Slated_defense_article-1) They are usually released just in advance of [Oscar season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_season), late in the calendar year, so as to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for the awards and be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters. The prestige or acclaim the studio may receive from the nomination or award is often secondary to the increased box office receipts such a film may garner; some films may even be depending on it to turn a profit.

抽象的多元宇宙喜剧《瞬息全宇宙》周日用它的“热狗手指”夺得了好莱坞的最高奖项，第 95 届奥斯卡奖的最佳影片，同时杨紫琼、关继威和杰米·李·柯蒂斯还获得了表演奖项。 虽然与专为奥斯卡而拍的作品相去甚远，但关家永和丹尼尔·施纳特的无厘头“芭蕾”中的一切——从贝果、豆豆眼石头到一场混乱的税务审计——都组成了一部奇异的奥斯卡重磅作品。这部火爆的独立电影是制作公司 A24 继《月光男孩》之后的第二部奥斯卡最佳影片，总共赢得了七项奥斯卡奖。
