Rescuers raced Tuesday to find survivors in the rubble of thousands of buildings brought down by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake and multiple aftershocks that struck eastern Turkey and neighboring Syria, with the discovery of more bodies raising the death toll to more than 5,000. Countries around the world dispatched teams to assist in the rescue efforts, and Turkey’s disaster management agency said more than 24,400 emergency personnel were now on the ground. But with such a wide swath of territory hit by Monday’s earthquake and nearly 6,000 buildings confirmed to have collapsed in Turkey alone, their efforts were spread thin.

土耳其东部和邻国叙利亚发生 7.8 级地震和多次余震，救援人员周二争分夺秒地在数千座震倒的建筑物废墟中寻找幸存者，发现的更多尸体使死亡人数增至 5000 多人。 世界各国都派出救援队伍协助救援工作，土耳其的灾害管理机构说，现在当地有超过 24,400 名救援人员。但是，周一的地震的影响面积极大，仅在土耳其就有近 6000 座建筑物被证实倒塌，救援人员的努力被分散了。
