Dozens of doctors and nurses silently lined the hospital `hallway` in `tribute`: For a history-making two months, a pig’s `kidney` worked normally inside the brain-dead man on the `gurney` rolling past them. The dramatic experiment came to an end Wednesday as `surgeons` at NYU Langone Health removed the pig kidney and returned the donated body of Maurice “Mo” Miller to his family for `cremation`. It marked the longest a genetically modified pig kidney has ever functioned inside a human, `albeit` a deceased one.
