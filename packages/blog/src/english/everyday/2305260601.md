China winning the Sudirman Cup `badminton` competition for the third time in a row sounds like the country is dominating the sport once again. However, the win is more of a confidence booster for the team as it has to face growing challenges from other national teams. The team's rich badminton legacy demands nothing less than `exemplary` performance. However, what set this campaign `apart` was the `infusion` of `youthful` energy and `talent` that promises to shape China's badminton `landscape` for years to come.
