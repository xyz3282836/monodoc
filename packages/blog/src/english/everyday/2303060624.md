Hélène Gravel’s house sits on Roxham Road near Canada’s most famous illegal `border` crossing, used by migrants leaving the United States to seek `asylum` up north. She has watched with increasing `frustration` as a `bitter` winter has failed to `stanch` record `inflows` and as New York City even began buying bus tickets for migrants headed her way. “There’s no political will to fix this,” Ms. Gravel, 77, said in her driveway, a stone’s throw from the border. “Canada is soft,” she said, adding that `asylum-seekers` should be processed at official border crossings. “And the United States doesn’t care because this is nothing compared with what’s happening on their southern border.”
