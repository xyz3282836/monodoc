The owner of the Guardian has issued an apology for the role the newspaper’s `founders` had in `transatlantic` slavery and announced a decade-long programme of `restorative` justice. The Scott Trust said it expected to invest more than £10 million (US$12.3 million), with millions `dedicated` specifically to `descendant` communities linked to the Guardian’s 19th-century founders.
