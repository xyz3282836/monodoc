Yiyun Li’s novel “The Book of Goose,” the story of two `mischievous` teenage girls in post-World War II France and their `improbable` `literary` success, has won the PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction. Li will receive $15,000 for the PEN/Faulkner. She has published both novels and story collections and received numerous other prizes, including the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story, presented to her last December.
