The credit agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the trustworthiness of the U.S. government on Tuesday, saying `successive` `standoffs` over the nation’s `debt` `ceiling` and rising federal debt have `cast` doubt on the United States’ ability to meet all its payment `obligations`. The downgrade, issued shortly after financial markets closed trading for the day, moves the federal government’s rating as a currency issuer from AAA to AA+. A lower credit rating could make borrowers less likely to lend money to the federal government on favorable terms, potentially raising costs for U.S. taxpayers.
