Microsoft on Tuesday reported a 9% increase in profit for the January-March quarter, as growth in cloud computing sales helped `bolster` its plans to expand its use of artificial intelligence. The company reported quarterly profit of \$18.3 billion, or $2.45 per share, `beating` Wall Street expectations for earnings of \$2.24 a share. The software maker `posted revenue` of \$52.9 billion in the period, its third `fiscal` quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago.
