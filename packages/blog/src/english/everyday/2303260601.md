Northern China has been hit by more sandstorms this March compared with previous years, the result of multiple factors including stronger winds generated by cold `fronts`, higher temperatures and poor vegetation coverage in the southern parts of Mongolia and northern China due to lower `precipitation`. Since the beginning of March, four `dust weather` events, including two sandstorms and two dust events have `buffeted` China, compared to only two last year, a statement from China’s National Forestry and `Grassland` Administration said.
