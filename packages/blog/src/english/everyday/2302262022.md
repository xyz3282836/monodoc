Though we tend to think of plants as static, many of them have always had to move to survive. A study published Feb. 6 by researchers found that 75% of the dominant plant groups in North America, including trees like pines and oaks, have migrated across the region over the last 18,000 years to track the movement of their ideal growing conditions. That plant migration will be harder to pull off over the coming decades, according to Jenny McGuire. “There’s so many barriers and filters to plant movement now.” she says.

尽管我们往往觉得植物是静止不动的，但许多植物总是要移动才能生存。研究人员 2 月 6 日发表的一项研究发现，北美 75%的优势植物，包括松树和橡树等树木，在过去 18,000 年中已经实现了在整个地区的迁徙，不断移动以寻找其理想生长环境。 珍妮·麦奎尔认为，这种植物迁徙在未来几十年将更难完成。"现在植物的迁徙需要面对太多的障碍和阻拦。"她说。
