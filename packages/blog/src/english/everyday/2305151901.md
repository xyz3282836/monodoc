David Bishop spends the school day as a `mild`-`mannered` `custodian`, but before the final bell rings, he grabs his chess boards and pieces and begins his second role. “The Queen’s Gambit” is playing out in real life in Maine, where this custodian is coaching his schools’ chess teams to `acclaim`. Bishop, a part-time chess coach and full-time custodian, led his `elementary` and middle school teams to state championship titles this year, drawing `comparisons` to the Netflix series about a chess `prodigy` inspired by a `janitor`.
