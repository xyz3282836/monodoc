Tesla said on Wednesday that it would build a factory in Mexico to `manufacture` an `electric vehicle` that would be significantly more `affordable` than any of the cars it sold now. But the company disappointed investors who were expecting it to make big announcements about new products and strategies. `Shareholders` and analysts had expected Tesla to `reveal` information that would `clarify` how the company would `retain` its crown as the world’s `dominant` maker of electric vehicles in the face of `energetic` competition from established carmakers and relatively younger Chinese manufacturers.
