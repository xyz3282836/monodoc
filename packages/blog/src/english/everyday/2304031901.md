Concert season is in full `swing`, with Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and other artists dominating calendars in the coming months. But a new `villain` is hurting the experience for many: superfans seeking five minutes of social-media `fame`. Homemade signs, `screaming` teenagers and `bouncing` beach balls aren’t new to concerts. What has changed is that, largely thanks to TikTok, any moment of a concert can go `viral`. More fans are trying to force that moment to happen with wild `shenanigans`, `annoying` noises or `demands` on artists to play unusual songs.
