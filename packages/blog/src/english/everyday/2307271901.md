According to reports, Japan is set to implement its plan to dump nuclear-`contaminated` wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the ocean in mid-August, drawing widespread international concern for food and `ecological` safety. Meanwhile, business at a related restaurant has reportedly already dropped by 10 to 20 percent in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). An owner of a Japanese restaurant in the HKSAR `surnamed` Lam said on a local program on Monday that news of Japan's dumping plan had already `stirred` up concerns among residents, causing up to 20 percent of `patrons` who used to order sashimi to avoid doing so, according to local media reports.
