To `quote` Taylor Swift’s own `lyrics`, “The `rumors` are terrible and `cruel`, but honey most of them are true.” Fans of Ms. Swift spent much of the weekend `grappling` with the possibility that the “Midnights” singer and her longtime boyfriend, the British actor Joe Alwyn, had broken up, after reports from “Entertainment Tonight” and People magazine said the couple was `through`. “ET” was `vague` about how it had come by the information, saying in its story on Friday afternoon only that it had “learned” that Ms. Swift and Mr. Alwyn had split. A few hours later, People matched the report with a story of its own citing an unnamed person close to the pair as its source. Both `outlets` said the breakup had occurred weeks ago.
