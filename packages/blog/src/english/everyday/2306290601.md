Climate-related risks are becoming an increasing challenge for `insurers`, the U.S. Treasury Department said, `urging` state regulators to step up their so-far “limited” efforts to `address` the issue. Insurers face a host of risks, from increased `litigation` to `reputational` harm, associated with climate change, but the response from regulators remains in its early stages, the `Treasury` Department’s `Federal` Insurance Office said in a report published Tuesday.
