Wish you could reword that `snarky` text message you just sent? WhatsApp is allowing users to do just that, for up to 15 minutes after they send a message. The popular chat app announced in a blog post Monday that users can correct misspellings, add more details or otherwise change what they have sent to friends, family and coworkers. The ability to edit messages has started `rolling out` to people worldwide and will be available to all users in coming weeks, according to the company owned by Facebook parent Meta.
