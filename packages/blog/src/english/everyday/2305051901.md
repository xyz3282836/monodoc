Multiple tourist spots across China have witnessed tickets being sold out and advised visitors to reschedule their plans as number from the May Day holidays in the world’s second-largest economy continues to `smash` all expectations. On Monday, authorities in Gulangyu island, the pedestrian-only island off the coast of Xiamen, announced all the `ferry` tickets to the island had been sold out, suggesting tourists who have not `purchased` tickets to visit island on another day. In Central China’s Wuhan city, `the Yellow Crane Tower,` the traditional Chinese tower has been at maximum receiving capacity for two days straight, roughly 40,000 people.
