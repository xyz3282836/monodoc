A woman’s leg has been `amputated` in a Thai airport after it became trapped by a movable walkway on Thursday, officials said. The 57-year-old Thai passenger was due to board a morning flight from Bangkok’s Don Mueang airport to Nakhon Si Thammarat province when she was caught by the walkway in `Terminal` 2. A medical team there eventually had to remove her left leg from above the knee, according to the airport’s officials.
