Britney Spears' husband Sam Asghari has said the pair have decided to end their "journey together" after 14 months of marriage. A `divorce` `petition` filed on Wednesday and seen by BBC News `cited` "`irreconcilable` differences" between Mr Asghari, 29, and Ms Spears, 41. The couple got `engaged` in September 2021 and were married in a small but star-`studded` ceremony in June 2022. `Rumours` of their marital `struggles` were reported in US `tabloids` this year.
