The U.K.’s annual rate of `inflation` was higher than expected in March and remained in double `digits`, a level of `persistent` price increases that could mean further `hikes` in interest rates in the coming months despite a weak economy. March consumer prices were 10.1% higher than a year earlier, a decline in the inflation rate from 10.4% in February, the U.K.’s statistics agency said Wednesday. That rate was higher than expected, with `economists` having `forecast` a drop to 9.8%.
