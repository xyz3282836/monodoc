American food and beverage regulators have recalled hundreds of thousands of Starbucks Vanilla Frappuccinos after their distributor warned the drinks could have glass in them. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said 25,200 cases of the caffeinated drink, carrying 12 bottles per case, were recalled starting 28 January after glass was detected inside the 13.7oz bottles. That means officials requested more than 300,000 bottles to be returned.

美国食品和饮料监管机构召回了数十万件星巴克香草星冰乐，因为其经销商警告说这些饮料中可能有玻璃。 美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）说，在 13.7 盎司的瓶子里检测到玻璃后，他们从 1 月 28 日起开始召回 25,200 箱含咖啡因的饮料，每箱中有 12 瓶。这意味着官方要求星巴克召回 30 多万瓶饮料。
