A Gold Coast man who filmed himself taking his pet snake for a surf has been fined by Australian wildlife authorities. Higor Fiuza and his `bredli` `carpet` python Shiva became local `celebrities` earlier this month after video of them catching waves went viral. But their short-lived fame also tipped off wildlife protection officers. They say the man endangered Shiva and `breached` his permit to keep the snake by taking her out in public. Queensland's Department of Environment and Science says it began investigating the surfing duo after Mr Fiuza appeared in local media, and this week issued him a fine of A$2,322.
