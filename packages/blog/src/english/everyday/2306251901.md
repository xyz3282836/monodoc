Glaciers are `melting` at `unprecedented` rates across the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain ranges and could lose up to 80% of their volume this century if greenhouse gas `emissions` aren’t sharply reduced, according to a report. The report Tuesday from Kathmandu-based International Centre for `Integrated` Mountain Development warned that flash floods and `avalanches` would grow more likely in coming years, and that the availability of fresh water could be `curtailed` for nearly 2 billion people who live downstream of 12 rivers that originate in the mountains.
