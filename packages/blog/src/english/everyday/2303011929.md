Thirteen Masai `giraffes` were darted and loaded onto trucks following a rescue effort in Kenya, after long being threatened by `poachers` and conflict with local `communities`. Native to East Africa, Masai giraffes are considered `endangered` by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with their population declining by 52% in recent decades due to `poaching` and `habitat` loss. `Veterinary` doctors and capture officers at the state-run Kenya Wildlife Service have moved them from the Moi Ndabi area in the Naivasha basin to `conservancies`, including to the Loldia farm, some 75 miles northwest of the capital Nairobi, where they will be monitored.
