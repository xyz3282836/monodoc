A Japanese man has been `sentenced` to death for an `arson` attack at a Kyoto animation studio in 2019 which killed 36 people and injured dozens more. The incident, one of Japan's deadliest in recent decades, killed mostly young artists and shocked the anime world. Shinji Aoba, 45, `pleaded` `guilty` to the attack but his lawyers had sought a lighter sentence, arguing grounds of "`mental` incompetence". Judges rejected this however, `ruling` Aobo knew what he was doing. "I have determined that the `defendant` was not mentally `insane` or weak at the time of the crime," Chief Judge Masuda said.
