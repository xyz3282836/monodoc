The world's largest `cruise` ship has set sail from Miami, Florida, on its `maiden` `voyage`, but there are concerns about the `vessel`'s `methane` `emissions`. The 365m-long Icon of the Seas has 20 decks and can house a maximum of 7,600 passengers. It is owned by Royal Caribbean Group. The vessel is going on a seven-day island-`hopping` voyage in the Caribbean. Environmentalists warn the `liquefied` natural gas (LNG)-powered ship will `leak` harmful methane into the air. Built at a shipyard in Turku, Finland, the Bahamas-registered ship has seven swimming pools and six water slides.
