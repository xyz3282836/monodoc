Chita Rivera, the vivacious Broadway musical star who `originated` roles in “West Side Story,” “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Chicago” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” won two competitive Tony Awards, and became one of the most honored Latina `entertainers` of her generation, died Jan. 30 in New York. She was 91. Her daughter, Lisa Mordente, announced the death but did not provide a specific cause. With her `raven` hair, `lithe` frame and smoky voice, Ms. Rivera cut a `mesmerizing` Broadway figure for more than six decades, her name `synonymous` with `vitality` and longevity on the musical stage.
