Celebrity giant panda He Ye, who has been believed to be male since it was born in July 2020, is in fact female, according to a post from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding on Wednesday. “When He Ye was just born, her gender `characteristics` `leaned` `toward` being male. A few months later, she showed more male-like characteristics such as high `urination`, lively personality, and tall stature, and these convinced everyone that He Ye was a boy,” a breeder surnamed Tan said in a video the base also posted.
