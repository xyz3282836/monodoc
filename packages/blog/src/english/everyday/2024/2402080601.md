The constancy of the moon in the night sky `belies` a more `volatile` reality, researchers said in new Nasa-funded research. As the core of the Earth’s only natural satellite cools, the moon is shrinking, causing it to `shrivel`. That creates `ripples` tens of meters high, called `thrust` faults, across the moon’s surface. In turn, those thrust faults can be the site of hours-long moonquakes and landslides, which could `imperil` people and robots as humans continue to explore the moon.
