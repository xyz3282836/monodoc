Seoul’s chief of police has been charged with professional `negligence` over the deadly `Halloween` crush in 2022 that killed nearly 160 people, `prosecutors` in the South Korean capital have said. Kim Kwang-ho, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), was charged with professional negligence resulting in injury or death, Seoul’s western district prosecutors’ office said in a statement released on Friday. As the chief of the SMPA, it is `alleged` he “did not take necessary measures, such as deploying `sufficient` police `forces` and ensuring proper command and `supervision`” on the day of the crush, the statement claimed.
