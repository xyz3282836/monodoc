Unlike the star of Disney’s Finding Nemo, real-life common `clownfish` are not `keen` on sharing their home with members of their own species. Researchers say they have discovered how they kick unwelcome guests out, by counting the stranger’s vertical white markings. According to previous research, the sea `anemones` that house common clownfish can also be a temporary home for other species – provided they have horizontal stripes or no stripes at all. However, common clownfish do not tend to `cohabit` with fish that have vertical markings like their own, instead experiments have shown they are more `aggressive` towards fish models painted with such patterns.
