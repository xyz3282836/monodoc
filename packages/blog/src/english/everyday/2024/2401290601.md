Alabama executed a `convicted` murderer with `nitrogen` gas Thursday, putting him to death with a first-of-its-kind method that once again placed the U.S. at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. The state said the method would be `humane`, but critics called it `cruel` and `experimental`. Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was `pronounced` dead at 8:25 p.m. at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen `deprivation`. It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since `lethal` injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982.
