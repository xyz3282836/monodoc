Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg was pushed to publicly apologise to the families of people who said they had been harmed by his social media platform, a dramatic moment in a heated congressional hearing over child safety online. Zuckerberg, whose Meta is the parent of popular platforms Facebook and Instagram, came under particular fire by `irate` lawmakers during Wednesday’s hearing before the `Senate` `judiciary` committee over whether social media companies have done enough to protect younger users from child `predators`, `pornography` and other harmful content.
