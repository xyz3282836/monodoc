With the world’s biggest annual human migration underway, Chinese people are `bracing` for disruption to their travel plans as extreme weather is set to hit almost half of the country over the next few days. Parts of China are likely to face their “most complicated” weather conditions during this year’s `Spring Festival travel rush`, known as chunyun, since 2008, the China Meteorological Administration said on Tuesday. Central and eastern areas may witness snowstorms and freezing rain until Feb. 5. Henan, Hubei, and Shandong provinces are forecast to see their heaviest snowfall on record for this time of year.
