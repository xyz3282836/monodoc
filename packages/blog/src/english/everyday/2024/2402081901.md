Karolinska Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, a `prominent` Swedish medical university home to the Nobel Assembly, faced a significant `setback` as research samples gathered over decades were destroyed due to a freezer `malfunction` during the Christmas holidays. Stored in `cryogenic` tanks cooled with liquid nitrogen at -190°C, the samples were `crucial` for various research `initiatives`. Between December 22 and 23, a malfunction occurred in the supply of liquid nitrogen to 16 cryogenic tanks, as reported by the Guardian.
