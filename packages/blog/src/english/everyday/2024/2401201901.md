It’s no joke. `Humorous` and `quirky` messages on electronic signs will soon disappear from highways and freeways across the country. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration has given states two years to implement all the changes outlined in its new 1,100-page manual released last month, including rules that `spells` out how signs and other traffic control devices are `regulated`. Administration officials said `overhead` electronic signs with obscure meanings, references to pop culture or those intended to be funny will be banned in 2026 because they can be misunderstood or `distracting` to drivers.
