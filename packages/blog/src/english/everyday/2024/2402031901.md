Boys and men from generation Z are more likely than older baby boomers to believe that `feminism` has done more harm than good, according to research. One in four UK males aged 16 to 29 believe it is harder to be a man than a woman and a fifth now `look favourably on` the social media influencer Andrew Tate, the polling of over 3,600 people found. Tate, the British-American former kickboxer who has 8.7 million followers on the social media platform X, is facing charges in Romania, which he denies, of human `trafficking`, `rape` and forming a criminal `gang` to sexually `exploit` women.
