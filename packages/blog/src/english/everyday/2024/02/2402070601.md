King Charles has been diagnosed with a form of cancer, says Buckingham Palace. The type of cancer has not been revealed - it is not `prostate` cancer, but was discovered during his recent treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King began "regular treatments" on Monday and will `postpone` public duties during it, the Palace said. The Monarch, 75, "remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible," it added. No further details are being shared on the stage of cancer or a `prognosis`.
