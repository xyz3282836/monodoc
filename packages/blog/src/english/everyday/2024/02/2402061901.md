Russian `cosmonaut` Oleg Kononenko has broken the world record for the most `cumulative` time spent in space, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos reported Sunday. The 59-year-old has now spent more than 878 days and 12 hours in space, `surpassing` fellow Russian Gennady Padalka, who set the previous record of 878 days, 11 hours, 29 minutes, and 48 seconds in 2015. Kononenko has made five journeys to the International Space Station, dating back to 2008.
