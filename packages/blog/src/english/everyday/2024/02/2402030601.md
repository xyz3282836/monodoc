How is everybody doing? The answer, it seems, is not great. When Elmo, the Muppet, `innocently` asked people how they were on X (formerly Twitter), thousands of users replied, sharing their `grief` and despair. The `Sesame` Street character has now responded, saying he's "glad he asked" and posting the hashtag "#EmotionalWellBeing". US President Joe Biden agreed, posting: "Our friend Elmo is right: We have to be there for each other." It all began with a `casual` question, posed by the much-loved children's TV character on Monday morning. "Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?" he asked on X.
