Universal Music is set to pull its millions of songs from TikTok after a breakdown in talks over payments. The move would mean the social media platform would no longer have access to songs by artists including Taylor Swift, The Weeknd and Drake. Universal `accused` TikTok of "`bullying`" and said it wanted to pay a "`fraction`" of the rate other social media sites do for access to its vast catalogue. TikTok said Universal was presenting a "false `narrative` and `rhetoric`".
