An international team led by scientists at Stanford University has discovered a probable explanation for a decades-old biological mystery: why `vastly` more women than men suffer from `autoimmune` diseases such as `lupus` and `rheumatoid` `arthritis`. Women account for about 80 percent of the people `afflicted` with autoimmune diseases, a collection of more than 100 `ailments` that `burden` a combined 50 million Americans, according to the nonprofit Autoimmune Association. In a paper published Thursday in the journal Cell, researchers present new evidence that a `molecule` called Xist — pronounced like the word “exist” and found only in women — is a major `culprit` in these diseases.
