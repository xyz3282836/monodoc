The organiser of a football match that superstar Lionel Messi sat out in Hong Kong, disappointing tens of thousands of fans, has `withdrawn` its application for HK$16 million in government `sponsorship` for the much-anticipated event in the face of public `outrage` and official pressure. Tatler Asia also revealed on Monday that Messi was said to be fit to play and included on the team sheet submitted by Inter Miami’s management before the match against a Hong Kong XI on Sunday. But Tatler Asia made no mention of refunds for fans, many from mainland China and some from as far away as Thailand, to see the footballing legend play.
