New Zealand will `repeal` on Tuesday a world-first law banning `tobacco` sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and `campaigners` warned of the risk that people could die as a result. Set to take effect from July, the `toughest` anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut `nicotine` content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%. The new `coalition` government `elected` in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to `scrap` the law without seeking public comment.
