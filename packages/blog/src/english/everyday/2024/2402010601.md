Toyota Motor said it is `urging` the owners of 50,000 older U.S. vehicles to get immediate recall repairs because an air bag `inflator` could explode and potentially kill `motorists`. The Japanese automaker said the "Do Not Drive" `advisory` covers some 2003-2004 model year Corolla, 2003-2004 Corolla Matrix, and 2004-2005 RAV4s with Takata air bag inflators. More than 30 deaths worldwide, including 26 U.S. deaths, and hundreds of injuries in various automakers' vehicles since 2009 are linked to Takata air bag inflators that can explode, `unleashing` metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.
