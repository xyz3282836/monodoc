Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes `sank` in 2023 to a nearly 30-year low, as sharply higher `mortgage` rates, rising prices and a persistently low level of homes on the market combined to push homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The National Association of `Realtors` said Friday that existing U.S. home sales totaled 4.09 million last year, an 18.7% decline from 2022. That is the weakest year for home sales since 1995 and the biggest annual decline since 2007.
