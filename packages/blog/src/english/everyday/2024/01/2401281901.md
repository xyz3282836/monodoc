Paris fashion has spoken: get ready for the year of the `tutu` skirt. Chanel has thrown its `might` behind 2024’s first breakout look, with `tulle` dancers’ skirts the stars of `the haute couture catwalk`. Days after the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the title sequence of Sex and the City sold for \$52,000 in Los Angeles – `outstripping` the estimate of \$8,000-\$12,000 expected by auction house Julien’s – Chanel has confirmed ballet as fashion’s new obsession.
