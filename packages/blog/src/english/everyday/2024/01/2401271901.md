Ariel, the six-legged dog found `dumped` in a supermarket car park, has had `surgery` to remove her extra `limbs`. The 11-week-old spaniel hit the headlines after being abandoned outside a Pembrokeshire branch of B&M in September. About £15,000 was raised by well-wishers all over the world, enabling her to have a life-changing operation. Surgeon Aaron Lutchman managed to save all four of her working limbs after fears one might have to be `amputated`. "She's doing really well, she's `bounced` back and she's a happy little dog and we're hoping she's going to go on to lead a `fabulous` little life," said Mr Lutchman.
