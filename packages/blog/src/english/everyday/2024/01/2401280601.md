The world’s first `pregnancy` in a `rhinoceros` through IVF could save the most endangered species on the planet, scientists hope. Northern white rhinos are functionally `extinct`, with just two females remaining after the last male died in 2018. Now in a major breakthrough an international group of scientists and `conservationists` has successfully transferred an embryo into a southern white rhino surrogate. Although the mother named Curra died within a few months of `conception` it marks a proof of concept which opens the door to transferring northern white rhino embryos.
