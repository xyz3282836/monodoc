Rescuers in China are racing to find dozens of people who are still left missing after a landslide struck a city in Yunnan province. The landslide in Zhaotong occurred at 05:51 local time on Monday, trapping 47 people and killing 11. `Preliminary` `investigations` show the landslide resulted from a collapse in a steep cliff, state media reported. The collapsed mass `measured` approximately 100m in width, 60m in height, with an average `thickness` of around 6m, Xinhua News Agency reported, `citing` city authorities.
