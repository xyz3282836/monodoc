Every year spent in school or university improves our life `expectancy`, while not attending school is as deadly as smoking or heavy drinking, according to the first systematic study directly linking education to gains in `longevity`. Using evidence from industrialised countries such as the UK and US as well as developing countries such as China and Brazil, the review found that an adult’s risk of `mortality` went down by 2% for every year in full-time education. Completing primary, secondary and `tertiary` education is the equivalent of a lifetime of eating a healthy diet, lowering the risk of death by 34% compared with those with no `formal` education, according to the peer-reviewed analysis in The Lancet Public Health journal.
