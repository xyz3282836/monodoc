Ryan Gosling has spoken out about his disappointment that Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie were not `nominated` in two major Oscar categories, despite receiving a `nod` himself. The actor, who on Tuesday was nominated for his supporting role as Ken in the box office `juggernaut`, described it as an “understatement” to say he was “disappointed” that Gerwig and Robbie were not nominated in their respective categories. “Their work should be recognised along with the other very deserving `nominees`,” he added.
