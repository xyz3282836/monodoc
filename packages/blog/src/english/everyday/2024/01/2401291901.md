The Pokémon Company says it plans to investigate `copycat` claims against online multiplayer `sensation` Palworld. Fans have been pointing out similarities after the new title exploded in popularity this week. In its first statement since, the Pokémon Company said it would take "appropriate action" if it found its copyright had been `breached`. The boss of Palworld maker Pocketpair has said the game passed legal checks before release. Palworld quickly earned the nickname "Pokémon with guns" when its first `trailer` was unveiled in 2021. Like the popular Nintendo franchise, it also centres around collecting dozens of strange `creatures` with different abilities.
