Cameroon will be the first country to `routinely` give children a new `malaria` `vaccine` as the shots are rolled out in Africa. The campaign due to start Monday was described by officials as a milestone in the decades-long effort to `curb` the mosquito-spread disease on the `continent`, which accounts for 95% of the world’s malaria deaths. “The `vaccination` will save lives. It will provide major `relief` to families and the country’s health system,” said Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at the Gavi vaccines alliance, which is helping Cameroon secure the shots.
