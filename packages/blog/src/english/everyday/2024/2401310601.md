Elon Musk said that the first human received a Neuralink brain `implant`, a potential milestone in the development of “brain-computer interface” technology that could one day help those suffering from `debilitating` conditions such as `paralysis` to interact with their surroundings. Musk tweeted late Monday that the `patient` received the implant the `prior` day and is “recovering well,” suggesting that the surgery was completed successfully and that there were no serious technical problems. Musk didn’t disclose details about the patient. When Neuralink announced last September that it was `recruiting` a trial participant, it said it was looking for someone suffering from `quadriplegia`.
