The US and the UK have conducted a further round of strikes against the Houthis in an attempt to stop the group targeting shipping in the southern Red Sea. A joint statement from both countries said that they had conducted “an additional round of `proportionate` and necessary strikes” against eight Houthi targets, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. The number of targets is `considerably` lower than the 60 which were struck in the first air `raids` on Yemen made by the two countries 10 days earlier.
