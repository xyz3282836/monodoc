Las Vegas has `unveiled` `Sphere`, a $2.3 billion entertainment `venue` that has a giant LED screen that displays a range of animations such as the moon and planets, `fireworks` and eyeballs. Construction began in 2018, and it fully `lit` up on July 4 with a fireworks show. Sphere is said to be the largest LED screen on Earth, at about 580,000 square feet, and has about 1.2 million `puck` lights. Each light has 48 `diodes`, a type of `semiconductor` device, each of which can display up to 256 million colors, according to Sphere Entertainment.
