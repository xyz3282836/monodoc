The recent `onslaught` of `precipitation` has flooded highways, broken `levees` and knocked out power for tens of thousands of `utility` customers, `inflicting` widespread `destruction` on Californians still `weary` from the back-to-back atmospheric river storms that `pummeled` the state in January. The `deluges` have also had another effect: `replenishing` `reservoirs` and building up `snowpack`, which has improved drought conditions across much of the state. This week, the U.S. Drought Monitor noted “`broad` `reductions` in drought `coverage` and `intensity`” across California and neighboring areas. But long-term concerns remain in a state where years of `aridity`, rising temperatures and `unsustainable` water use have left their mark, experts say.
