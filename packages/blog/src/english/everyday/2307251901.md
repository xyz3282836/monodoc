A quarter of a century after the late president Jacques Chirac promised Parisians they would be able to swim in the Seine within three years, the French capital’s `mayor` has confirmed three river bathing areas are to open in the city in 2025. The sites – opposite the central Île Saint-Louis in the centre, by the Quai de Grenelle in the 15th `arrondissement` to the west, and at Bercy in the eastern 12th arrondissement – will be monitored by `lifeguards` and marked by buoys, Anne Hidalgo said on Sunday.
