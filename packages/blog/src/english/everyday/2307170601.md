The sweetener aspartame is a “possible carcinogen” but it remains safe to consume at already agreed levels, two groups linked to the World Health Organization (WHO) have declared. The `rulings` are the outcome of two separate WHO `expert panels`, one of which flags whether there is any evidence that a `substance` is a potential `hazard`, and the other which `assesses` how much of a real-life risk that substance poses. Aspartame is one of the world’s most popular sweeteners, used in products from Coca-Cola `diet` `sodas` to Extra `chewing` `gum`. In a press conference before the announcement, the WHO’s head of nutrition, Francesco Branca, tried to help consumers make sense of the seemingly conflicting declarations, especially those who seek out artificial sweeteners to avoid sugar.
