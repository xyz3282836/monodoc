Hong Kong superstar Sammi Cheng has been named Best Actress by a `panel` of film critics for the first time in 22 years, according to a list of winners released by the Hong Kong Film Critics Society on Monday. The 50-year-old singer-actress received the award for her role in the movie Lost Love (2023), in which she plays a mother trying to overcome the death of her young son by becoming a `foster` parent. Cheng, who `declined` to be paid for the project as she loved the storyline, said the win came as a surprise and that the `recognition` holds great significance for her.
