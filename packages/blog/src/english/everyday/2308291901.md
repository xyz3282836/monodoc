In an idea that `fittingly` arose over a cup of coffee, researchers have devised a technique to recycle used coffee grounds to make stronger `concrete`. Engineers at RMIT University say they have developed a way to make concrete nearly 30% stronger by `incorporating` processed coffee grounds into the material. The researchers have `converted` waste coffee grounds into `biochar`, a `lightweight` `residue` similar to `charcoal`, and used that biochar to replace a portion of the `sand` required to make concrete.
