Beginning August, Walmart-owned Sam’s Club and Alibaba’s Freshippo — China’s leading supermarket giants — have been `striving` to `outdo` each other in an `intensifying` tit-for-tat price war aimed at enhancing their market dominance and attracting more consumers. According to China Economic Weekly, the price war began on Aug. 1 when Freshippo, known as Hema in Chinese, cut the price of its durian layer cake from 128 yuan (\$17.60) to 98.90 yuan in Beijing and Shanghai. Soon after, Sam’s Club reduced the price of the same cake to 98.80 yuan.
