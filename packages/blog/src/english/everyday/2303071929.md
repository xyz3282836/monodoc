Manchester United’s `humiliations` at the hands of their biggest `rivals` were supposed to have been `confined` to last season. But on an afternoon when Liverpool `relocated` something that has seemed lost at times, `sparking` what they believe can be a successful push for a top-four Premier League finish, United were `reacquainted` with their worst nightmares. This was even worse than the horrors of the previous `campaign` mainly because they had made the short journey to Anfield on a high, having lost only once in 22 matches, collecting the Carabao Cup in the process.
