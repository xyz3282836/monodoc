The Energy Department said it is planning to provide up to \$12 billion in funding for automakers to `retrofit` existing manufacturing facilities in the U.S. for the production of electric and `hybrid` vehicles. Most of the funding, some \$10 billion, will be allocated from an advanced-vehicle manufacturing program `overseen` by the department’s `Loan` Programs Office, Energy `Secretary` Jennifer Granholm said. The other \$2 billion will come from funds allocated by last year’s Inflation `Reduction` Act. The funds will help provide jobs in longstanding automaking communities as the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, Granholm said.
