This summer, climate change has been blamed for many extreme weather events in China, from heatwaves to sandstorms. But for the country’s northern residents, perhaps the worst impact has been the increased appearance of `cockroaches`. `Anecdotes` by residents in northern provinces suggest that cockroaches are appearing more frequently in their homes and businesses. Meanwhile, creative netizens who are `obsessed` with cockroaches are generating `memes` about the insect’s northern `expedition` and even creating cockroach-themed tarot cards.
