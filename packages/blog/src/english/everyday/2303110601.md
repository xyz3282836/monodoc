More than 1.2 million `protesters` `marched` in France on Tuesday as rail workers and refinery staff began `rolling strikes` and trade `unions` stepped up their `campaign` to try to stop Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the `pension` age to 64. For the sixth time since the start of the year, trade unions called a nationwide day of strikes and `demonstrations`. Many protest `rallies` attracted bigger `crowds` than previous ones organised since mid-January, including in Marseille, one of France’s biggest cities, `authorities` and local media said.
