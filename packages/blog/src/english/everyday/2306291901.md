Prince William launched a five-year project to end homelessness in the United Kingdom on Monday, saying he wants to make sure that instances of people being left without a roof over their heads are “rare, brief and unrepeated.” The `heir` to the `throne` kicked off the `initiative` by visiting `pilot` projects that have received grants of up to 500,000 pounds ($637,000) each from the Royal Foundation, the `charity` that supports the work of William and his wife, Kate.
