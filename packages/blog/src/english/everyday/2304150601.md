Former president Donald Trump said he wouldn’t drop out of the 2024 race even if `convicted` of a crime. “I’d never drop out, it’s not my thing,” Trump said in an interview that `aired` Tuesday with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. “I wouldn’t do it.” The interview was Trump’s first national media appearance since he was `indicted` last week in New York on 34 counts of `falsifying` business records.
