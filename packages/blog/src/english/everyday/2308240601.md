The British Museum has `sacked` a member of staff and imposed “emergency measures” to increase security after it found items from its collection to be missing. It launched an independent review of security after items including gold jewellery and gems of `semiprecious` stones and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD were found to be missing, stolen or damaged. Legal action against the `dismissed` member of staff will be taken and the matter is also being investigated by the economic crime command of the `Metropolitan` police.
