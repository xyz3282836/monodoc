`Inflation` fell in May to around half last year’s peak but remained `elevated`, showing Federal Reserve officials made progress in cooling price pressures but could have more work to do. The consumer-price index rose 4% last month from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, well below the recent peak of 9.1% last June and down from April’s 4.9% increase.
