Hollywood writers, studios and streamers said Sunday that they have reached a `tentative` agreement that would end a monthslong strike. The new three-year deal includes several hard-`fought` victories for the writers including increased `royalties`, `mandatory` staffing for television “writing rooms” and protections `regarding` the use of artificial intelligence, people familiar with the `pact` said. Neither side would address the terms of the accord. The Writers Guild of America said it is still `finalizing` the `memorandum` of agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a `coalition` representing movie and TV studios, networks and streamers.
