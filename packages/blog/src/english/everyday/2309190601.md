A Nasa probe into hundreds of UFO sightings found there was no evidence aliens were behind the unexplained phenomena, but the space agency also could not rule out that possibility. If the truth is out there, this long-awaited report offers no conclusive evidence. But it did outline how Nasa will investigate what it calls UAPs (Unidentified `Anomalous` Phenomena) with improved technology and artificial intelligence. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said the US space agency will not only take the lead in researching possible UAP incidents, but will share data with more `transparency`.
