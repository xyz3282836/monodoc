China has set its annual GDP growth target at around 5 percent for 2023, as the country `embarked` on a rapid economic recovery after a `decisive` victory against COVID-19, while putting `emphasis` on ensuring economic stability and high-quality growth, `sustainable` development amid global economic `volatility` and `geopolitical` uncertainty. While the growth target is reportedly the lowest in dozens of years, it still means China will continue to be one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.
