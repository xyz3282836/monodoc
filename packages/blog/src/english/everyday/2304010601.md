Elon Musk said Twitter Inc. employees will receive stock awards based on a `roughly` $20 billion valuation, less than half of the $44 billion price he acquired the company for last year, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Musk in the note to staff said he was `optimistic` about the social-media company’s future. “I see a clear, but difficult, path to a >$250 Billion valuation,” meaning stock granted now would be worth 10 times more, he said.
