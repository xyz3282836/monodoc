Researchers and monster hunters are gathering in the United Kingdom's Scottish Highlands this weekend to look for the `eternally` `elusive` Loch Ness Monster, the biggest search for the legendary `beast` in more than 50 years. Somewhere `beneath` the `shimmering` surface of Loch Ness lies Nessie, the legendary sea beast whose `reputation` spans nearly 1,500 years — at least, that's what monster hunters and Nessie `enthusiasts` from around the world hope to prove Saturday and Sunday. The Loch Ness Centre and the research group Loch Ness Exploration are asking all `aspiring` monster hunters to join in on the biggest search since 1972.
