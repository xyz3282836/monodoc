When 35-year-old Chinese pianist Wang Yujia finished her last note on Tuesday, she received a standing ovation from the audience. Conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, commonly known as Yannick, of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra even "knelt down" after her four-hour performance at the Carnegie Music Hall. The repertoire she played covered all five of Rachmaninoff's piano works - four piano concertos and the Paganini Theme Rhapsody. She was acclaimed as a superstar for her "once-in-a-lifetime" performance.

周二，当 35 岁的中国钢琴家王羽佳弹奏出最后一个音符时，她获得了观众的起立鼓掌。她在卡内基音乐厅进行了 4 个小时的表演后，指挥家 Yannick Nézet-Séguin，也就是执棒费城交响乐团的“杨尼克”甚至向她单膝下跪。王羽佳的此次演奏曲目包括了拉赫玛尼诺夫全部五套钢琴曲——四套钢琴协奏曲和《帕格尼尼主题狂想曲》。因为此次“千载难逢”的表演，她被盛赞为“超级巨星”。
