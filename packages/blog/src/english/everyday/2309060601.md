On 5 June, Lee Min-so\* described in her `diary` the fear that `overtook` her body as she entered her classroom to teach: "My `chest` feels too tight. I feel like I'm going to fall somewhere. I don't even know where I am." On 3 July the primary school teacher wrote that she had become so `overwhelmed` by the `craziness` of work she "wanted to let go". Two weeks later, the 23-year-old was found dead in her classroom store `cupboard` by her `colleagues`. She had taken her own life. This `tragedy` has `unleashed` a wave of anger from primary school teachers across South Korea. Tens of thousands of them `went on strike` on Monday to demand better protection at work.
