Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and other technology heavyweights debated the possibilities and risks of artificial intelligence Wednesday in a closed-door meeting with more than 60 U.S. `senators` who are `contemplating` `legislation` to regulate the technology. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter), warned about what he views as AI’s potential to threaten humanity, according to a participant. Microsoft co-founder Gates said the technology could help address world hunger, said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who `convened` the session. Other speakers included Facebook founder Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and IBM, along with union leaders, `civil-rights` advocates and others.
