A Danish artist who pocketed large sums of money `lent` to him by a museum – and submitted empty frames as his artwork – has been ordered by a court to repay the funds. Jens Haaning, a conceptual artist, was `commissioned` in 2021 by the Kunsten Museum of Modern Art in Aalborg, northern Denmark, to recreate two earlier works. Haaning’s 2007 work, An Average Danish Annual Income, displayed `krone` notes fixed to canvas in a frame, and a second 2011 work about Austrian incomes used `euro` `bills`. The museum provided about 532,000 krone (£61,500) to recreate artworks as well as an artist’s fee of about 40,000 krone. But when staff unpacked the newly delivered works, they found two empty frames with the title Take the Money and Run.
