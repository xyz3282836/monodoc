Sales of previously owned homes fell in April from the `prior` month and prices declined from a year earlier by the most in more than 11 years. U.S. existing home sales, which make up most of the housing market, fell 3.4% in April from the prior month, the National Association of `Realtors` said Thursday. April sales fell 23.2% from a year earlier. The national median existing-home price fell 1.7% in April from a year earlier to $388,800, the biggest year-over-year price decline since January 2012, NAR said.
