If you’ve never played an `instrument` before, the brain-boosting benefits could be even more powerful. The Swiss and German scientists behind a research showed that learning the piano in later life can actually slow down the process of `cognitive` decline in people with little or no past musical training. After six months of weekly piano lessons, the study `participants`, who were between 62 and 78 years old, performed better in tests that challenged their working memory, like remembering directions, an ability which `tends` to decrease with age.
