What's the longest river in the world, the Nile or the Amazon? The question has `fueled` a heated debate for years. Now, an `expedition` into the South American `jungle` aims to settle it for good. Using boats run on solar energy and `pedal` power, an international team of explorers plans to set off in April 2024 to the source of the Amazon in the Peruvian Andes, then travel nearly 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) across Colombia and Brazil, to the massive river's mouth on the Atlantic.
