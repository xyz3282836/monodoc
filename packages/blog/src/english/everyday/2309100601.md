A newly discovered comet is swinging through our cosmic neighborhood for the first time in more than 400 years. Stargazers across the Northern `Hemisphere` should catch a `glimpse` as soon as possible — either this week or early next — because it will be another 400 years before the wandering ice ball returns. The comet, which is kilometer-sized (1/2-mile), will sweep safely past Earth on Sept. 12, passing within 78 million miles (125 million kilometers).
