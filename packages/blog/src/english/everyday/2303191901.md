`Artificial` `intelligence` can now outperform most law school graduates on the bar exam, the `grueling` two-day test `aspiring` `attorneys` must pass to practice law in the United States, according to a new study released Wednesday. GPT-4, the upgraded AI model released this week by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, scored 297 on the bar exam in an experiment `conducted` by two law professors and two employees of legal technology company Casetext. That places GPT-4 in the 90th percentile of actual test takers and is enough to be `admitted` to practice law in most states, the researchers found.
