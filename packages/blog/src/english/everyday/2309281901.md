Lego is `scrapping` plans to make its toy `bricks` from recycled plastic bottles after determining that switching to the material would result in it producing higher carbon `emissions`. The world’s biggest toy maker said it hasn’t given up on its yearslong effort to make its bricks out of something other than `petroleum`-based plastics. But it said Monday it is giving up on a high-profile effort launched just over two years ago to make the bricks out of recycled polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic bottles.
