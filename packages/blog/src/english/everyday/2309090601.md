Hong Kong reported 158.1mm of rainfall in the space of an hour on Thursday night, the highest since records began in 1884, causing widespread flooding and `disrupting` road and rail traffic. The record rain, reported in the hour up to midnight on Thursday, comes just days after the city `dodged` major damage from a super typhoon. Late on Thursday, authorities in the Chinese city said various `districts` had been flooded and `emergency` services were `conducting` rescue operations. Members of the public were instructed to stay in a safe place.
