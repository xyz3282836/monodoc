The Paris Saint-Germain forward Lionel Messi has been suspended for two weeks after an unauthorised trip for two days to Saudi Arabia and will not have his `contract` `renewed`, French sports daily L’Equipe has reported. The Argentina World Cup winner is banned from playing or training with the team, and his pay will be `docked` during his suspension, the report said. Messi signed an optional third-season `clause` in his contract when he first arrived in 2021. Club officials have decided not to activate it, the report said.
