Emmanuel Macron has `resorted` to bringing his own generator as he tours France to `quell` anger at his pension `reforms`, after unions cut power to a factory and college he visited last week. The fact that Mr Macron was forced to bring his own power supply to ensure he could be heard was revealed by a French broadcaster. The generator is being transported on a white truck, which was parked outside of the health centre to, in the words of the TV journalist, “avoid what happened last week”.
