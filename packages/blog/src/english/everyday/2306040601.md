Experts say this is likely to be one of the deadliest years on record on Mount Everest, with variable weather caused by climate change being blamed as one of the main reasons for the deaths of up to 17 people. A total of 12 people have now been confirmed dead during Everest `expeditions` this season and another five are missing, `presumed` dead, as no contact has been made for at least five days in all cases, according to the Himalayan Database, which tracks mountain `fatalities`.
