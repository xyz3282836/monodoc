An `outage` on Twitter Inc.’s social-media platform appeared to be mostly resolved early Wednesday, after the service failed to load for users across several regions. Thousands of users reported problems with the site to Downdetector, a website that tracks service `disruptions`. The site said around 10,000 people had reported experiencing the outage, starting at around 5 a.m. ET. The latest outage to affect the popular platform comes just days after Chief Executive Elon Musk announced another round of jobs cuts over the weekend.
