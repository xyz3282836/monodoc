The LEGO Master Builder is the `ultimate` creator who can make building fun and educational for Legoland guests. They lead workshops for younger Lego builders, teach education classes, design Lego displays and much more. To be a Lego Master Builder you must have both the talent to build with Lego and the ability to inspire other builders. Lego Master Builders also frequently attend media appearances and are always in the public eye.
