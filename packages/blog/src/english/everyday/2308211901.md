Train passengers between north and southernmost Switzerland will have to skip the world’s longest train `tunnel` and go back to the longer `scenic` route for months, rail authorities have said, after a `freight` service `derailed` and `tore up` the track. Sixteen cars that jumped the tracks in last Thursday’s derailment remained stuck inside the 57km (35-mile) long Gotthard base tunnel in the southern Ticino region, national railway operator SBB said on Wednesday. No one was injured but the damage was considerable. Pictures showed, among other things, wine bottles `strewn` along the tracks.
