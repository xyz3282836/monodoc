Americans are keeping their cars longer than ever. The average age of a passenger `vehicle` on the road hit a record 12.5 years this year, according to data gathered by S&P Global Mobility. Sedans like Holdsworth’s are even older, on average — 13.6 years. `Blame` it mainly on the `pandemic`, which in 2020 triggered a global shortage of `automotive` computer chips, the `vital` component that runs everything from radios to gas `pedals` to `transmissions`. The shortage `drastically` slowed global `assembly` lines, making new vehicles `scarce` on `dealer` lots just when consumers were increasingly `eager` to buy.
