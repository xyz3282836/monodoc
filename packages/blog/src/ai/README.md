## Stable Diffusion

::: tip 介绍

**Stable Diffusion** is a [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [text-to-image model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model) released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as [inpainting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting), outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a [text prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering).[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#cite_note-:0-3) It was developed by the start-up Stability AI in collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organizations.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#cite_note-stable-diffusion-launch-4)

Stable Diffusion is a [latent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable_model) [diffusion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model), a kind of deep generative [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network). Its code and model weights have been released [publicly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software),[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#cite_note-stable-diffusion-github-5) and it can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) with at least 8 GB [VRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_random_access_memory). This marked a departure from previous proprietary text-to-image models such as [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E) and [Midjourney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney) which were accessible only via [cloud services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_service).[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#cite_note-pcworld-6)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#cite_note-verge-7)
